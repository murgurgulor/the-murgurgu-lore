A Skill Challenge provides a non-combat mode challenge to the PCs to reach a Goal. Combat may be (narrative) part of the Challenge, but it's resolved in an abstract manner rather than using the regular combat rules. 

For a Skill Challenge to make sense, the PCs must want to reach a certain Goal and there must be one or more Obstacles in their way to reach that goal (either passive or active).

Below is covered how to create the framework of a Skill Challenge, how to build the different Stages and how to finally run and resolve the Challenge.

# Skill Challenge Framework
- Determine the Goal of the Challenge (where do the PCs want to be or what do they want to have achieved)?
- Is the Goal Static or Dynamic?
	- Static: there are no other limiting factors (time, efficiency) besides the Obstacles to reaching the Goal. No matter how long it takes the PCs to achieve the Goal, the Goal remains the same. For example: scaling a large cliff wall to reach the top without the need for speed or stealth.
	- Dynamic: there are limiting factors besides the Obstacles that can alter the degree of success upon reaching the Goal. If the PCs don't resolve the Challenge in a specific time or manner, the Goal might change. For example: making your way through a gauntlet in time to prevent a wizard from setting off a spell. Complete success means the spell is fully prevented, partial success means the brunt of the spell is prevented but the wizard has achieved some effect, failure means the spell gets set off.
		- If there is a Dynamic Goal, determine how the outcome of the Challenge may be changed by failures and successes of the PCs. This can be as granular as you want it to be, but try to aim for 2 or 3 different outcomes (Full Success, (Partial Success), Minimal Success/Failure) and decide what the 'default' outcome is.
- What are the Environments the PCs must proceed through in order to achieve their Goal?
- What kind of Obstacles, either passive or active, are there in the Environment that hinder the PCs reaching their Goal?

# Building the Challenge
## Setting Stages
Once the Framework has been established, determine how long the Challenge should take. This decides how many Stages the Challenge has. Each Stage must have either a different Environment or different Obstacle than the other ones. If two Stages take place in exactly the same Environment with exactly the same Obstacles, merge them into one Stage. Going through one hallway and overcoming a series of traps only to come into a similar hallway with yet more traps is not very interesting.

Most Challenges have between 1-3 Stages, depending on how long you want them to last. Short Challenges will have just one Stage, Long Challenges will have three. Going above 3 Stages represent lengthy and epic Challenges that must have an important Goal.

The amount of time a Stage takes is fluid. When traversing a dangerous hallway, each Stage may only represent a number of seconds. When preparing a grand magic ritual, each Stage might represent hours or days worth of time. Stages need not be fully consecutive: you or the players can narrate a montage in between Stages where the PCs progress through a different (or the same) Environment but no Obstacles have to be overcome or rolls are made.

---

# Running the Challenge

---

## Moving through Stages
When the PCs enter a Stage of a Challenge, describe the Environment and Obstacles present in the Stage. Be sure to add detail to the Environment to give the players inspiration on how they can overcome the Obstacles. Make it clear if there is a limit to how many PCs can take an action to overcome the Stage. Three distinctions are:
- Only 1 PC can make a single unassisted check
- A specific number of PCs can make a check, and others can provide help
- All PCs can make a check

### Declaring and Resolving Tasks
Each PC gets to perform a Task to try and overcome the Obstacles in the Stage. Let their imagination run wild. If they suggest a feature might be present in the Stage to base a cool Task off, be lenient ('sure, there can be a chandelier on the ceiling to swing from!'). If they want to incorporate a flashback of preparation they might have done earlier, allow that with leniency as well. The PCs can declare their Tasks in whatever order they want. If it makes sense narratively, if one player declares an action that would create new opportunities for other Tasks, they can build on that. If the players can't decide or don't want to decide on an order themselves, let them roll Initiative to decide the order.

When a Task is declared, the GM and player decide on what kind of check is required to complete the Task. Most Tasks will be skill checks. If the Task selected involves taking out opposition by fighting, use an attack roll (condensating combat into a single roll). If a PC with magical capabilities wants to use their magic but not a specific spell (which may be a limited resource), they can explain what magical effect they want to produce and roll their spellcasting modifier+lvl. Players can also decide to expend one of their limited Resources to fulfill a Task. In this case a roll is not required, they get an automatic success.

Sometimes not all players can (or have to) think of a separate action for their PC. In that case they can choose to help another PC instead. If they explain how they help out, the other PC gets a +2 to their roll. Any negative consequences of a failed roll then apply to both PCs. Generally only one PC can help one other, but in some cases - if it makes sense in the narrative - two or more PCs might provide help to a single ally.

Once a player has declared their Task and the type of roll has been decided, the player rolls their dice. After the dice are rolled, the GM compares the results to the DC for the Tasks and narrates the outcome. If wanted, the players can also add to the narrative of the outcome. This process continues until every PC has rolled for a Task or has aided on a Task (so everyone has had a chance to contribute).

The DC for Tasks in the Challenge are based on the environmental tier. DCs can be shifted up or down at the GM's discretion. Always communicate the difficulty of a proposed Task to the player before they roll. Failed Tasks almost always come with a cost or complication to the PC (HP loss, resource loss, ongoing penalty to a certain ability or attacks).

##### Task Difficulty 
| Task Difficulty       | Adventurer Tier | Champion Tier | Epic Tier |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Easy**              | DC 10           | DC 15         | DC 20     |
| **Normal** (default)  | DC 15           | DC 20         | DC 25     |
| **Hard**              | DC 20           | DC 25         | DC 30     |
| **Nearly impossible** | DC 25           | DC 30         | DC 35     |

If a PC uses a limited Resource to fulfill their Task, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached.

### Stage Resolution
After every Task has been rolled and the narrative has proceeded, the PCs move on to the next stage. Always apply failing forward here: the Stage ends after everyone has performed their Task, even if all rolls were a failure. The narrative in which they move on to the next stage might just not look so good, and they'll likely incur some costs/complications. In the case of a Challenge with a Dynamic Goal, a string of failures might negatively affect the final outcome of the Challenge.

### The Next Stage
In the next stage, a new Environment and/or Obstacle is presented to the PCs. Everyone thinks of their Tasks as before. However, their previous attempts may have wearied them out. If a player wants to handle a Task with an exact roll they've already employed earlier in the Challenge, the difficulty of the Task moves up one level (DC+5).

---

## Reaching the Goal
When the final Stage of the Challenge has concluded, the PCs reach their Goal.

### Static Goals
In the case of a Static Goal, they achieve just that. The outcome of the different Stages determine whether they suffer any negative consequences while doing so. Any successful roll means the PC accomplished their Task in a Stage without any real difficulty. Any failed roll means the PC accomplished their Task with difficulty or at a cost, such as HP loss, Recovery loss, loss of an item or an ongoing penalty to a specific ability score, attacks or defenses until a next full rest.

### Dynamic Goals
In the case of a Dynamic Goal, the outcome of each Stage influences the final Goal that the players achieve. As a rule of thumb: if **at least half of the Stages are successful**, there is a positive effect on the Goal. The final Goal that is achieved is a culmination of the successes and failures of each Stage. The default Goal (good, neutral or bad) is up to the GM.

#### What determines if a Stage is successful?
To have a Stage be resolved successfully, the PCs have to obtain a score of **more than half** the amount of Tasks performed\. So if a party of 5 PCs decides on performing 4 Tasks (with 1 PC helping another), at least 3 points must be earned for a successful outcome of the Stage. Assign points to the score as follows:

| Outcome of the Task Roll | Points awarded                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DC to DC+4*               | 1 point                                                                            |
| DC+5 or higher           | 2 points                                                                           |
| DC-1 to DC-5             | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a minor cost/complication to the PC (player's choice)                    |
| Lower than DC-5          | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a major cost/complication to the PC (player's choice) |

* As before: if a limited Resource is used, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached (so award 1 point)

Note that, unlike with a Static Goal, a failed roll does not automatically mean a cost or complication. As a failed roll already can negatively contribute to the Dynamic Goal, punishing a PC for a failed roll as well is unfair. However, if needed to complete a successful Stage, a player with a failed roll can always choose to take a cost/complication in order to add a point to the score. This might pose interesting dilemmas for the player who first declares their Task if they roll a failure, as they won't know how the rest will perform!

## Ending the Challenge
After all the Stages of the Challenge have been completed, present the Goal that they have accomplished. With a Static Goal this is just the only outcome. With a Dynamic Goal, tally up the successful and failed Stages to determine the final outcome.

# Example 1
Boudica, Barbazoobo, Daniel and Kaggra have found themselves trapped in a cursed item of the Lich Queen's making! They are trapped in a pocket dimension graveyard where all manner of undead horrors and terrors will continue assailing them until they break the curse from within!

To resolve this scene, the GM decides to run it as a Skill Challenge. 
- The Goal is to break free by destroying a cursed object in the pocket dimension. This is a Static Goal: there is no other party involved that can change this goal.
- The Environment is the pocket dimension graveyard, but to change things up a bit, the GM decides that the cursed object is located in an ornate mausoleum.
- The GM thinks of a few thematic Obstacles: a horde of rotting zombies, clawing skeletal hands reaching up from the ground, the door to the mausoleum might be locked, and corpse bats might fly in at some point.
- Finally the length of the Challenge. Considering the scene they're in and the fact that the PCs are relatively good on health and resources, the GM makes this a 3 Stage Challenge. The Stages are set as followed:
	1. Figuring out how to end the curse
	2. Getting to the mausoleum
	3. Breaking in the mausoleum

With this framework set up, the GM is ready to run the Challenge! She explains to the players that the next scene will play out like a Skill Challenge, and goes over the rules: she'll set the scene for a Stage, and then everyone gets a chance to do something to advance their position in that scene.

>[!quote]
>*GM: So, you guys find yourself falling through the empty void of interplanar space and with a dull thud you suddenly smack on slimy, wet grass. When you look around you, you notice a pitch black sky, yet there seems to be an ambient light around without an apparent source. The place you find yourself in brings a shiver to your spine. In the widespread ground covered in mulch and long, unkept grass you see broken tombstones jutting angles out of the ground in all angles like crooked, jagged teeth. In the distance you notice some buildings with ghoulish stone guardians in front of the doors - mausoleums. The air is cloying with a thick, heavy scent of rot and decay.* 
>
>*You gather yourselves up and take stock of your situation. It seems you have been transported to some deadly environment. Just when you start thinking about how you're going to get out of this place - certainly this must be some magical effect - you hear a screech in the air, quickly joined by hundreds of other screeches. The flapping of leathery torn wings on the air. A swarm of gauntly bats are making their way to you!*
>
>*So, you've landed in a terrifying strange environment that most certainly seems unnatural, and a swarm of terrifying beasts is flying your way. Your goal is to make it out of here and stay alive! (It's good to specify the situation and the goal to the players, so there's no confusion about what the Challenge is about.) What do you do?*
>
>---
>**Daniel:** Ok, I try to think back to my magical training and education. Is there anything I can think of that would explain where we are and how we can get out?
>
>**GM:** Sure, roll INT to see what you know.
>
>**Kaggra:** Can I help?
>
>**GM:** Well how would you help Daniel try to remember something?
>
>**Kaggra:** I have some magical knowledge myself, I'd let him bounce ideas off of me or try to suggest avenues of him to think in?
>
>**GM:** Sure that works, Kaggra is acting as a soundboard for Daniel while he's trying to figure this whole situation out, please roll INT with a +2 bonus for the help.
>
>*The roll comes up as 16 total. The GM has set this Task as a default difficulty with a DC15, so Daniel has passed the check.*
>
>**GM:** Daniel, with the help of Kaggra you deduce that, considering the light conditions and odd theme of this place, you must be in some sort of pocket dimension. Usually at the center of such a dimension there is an object that you can manipulate to extract yourself.
>
>**Daniel:** Do I know where to look for it?
>
>**GM:** No, you've had your turn for this Stage, it's up to Barbazoobo and Boudica to do something now. That swarm of skeletal bats is coming awfully close though!
>
>**Boudica:** I'm no good with this magic stuff, so I just want to fire my crossbow into that swarm in order to buy us more time or scare them off or something.
>
>**GM:** Ok, make an attack roll to signify your assault on these creatures.
>
>*The roll comes up as a 12 total. This was once again a DC15 check, so it has failed. Boudica will have to pay the price!*
>
>**GM:** Boudica you fire bolt after bolt into the swarm of bats, and you definitely drop a bunch of them from the sky, but then they're on you and start clawing at your face! Please take 2d6 damage.
>(*Adjust any HP damage to the level of the party, the danger of the Challenge and their current situation. Sometimes it's good to hurt them a lot, sometimes you can go easy on them!*)
>
>**Boudica:** grumble
>
>**GM:** Barbazoobo, you're left in this Stage, what do you want to do? You know there's an object somewhere that could get you out, but Boudica is also being harrassed by these bats, what do you do?
>
>**Barbazoobo:** I want to protect Boudica! I jump in with my spear and start whacking those things out of the way!
>
>**GM:** Also make an attack roll then please
>
>*The roll comes up as a 23 total. That's quite a bit higher than the DC15 difficulty but as this is a Challenge with a Static Goal, this extreme success doesn't bring anything extra in.*
>
>**GM:** You jump in successfully and start whacking those bats out of the way, and you manage to yank Boudica out from the swarm and into the open again.
>Now, while Boudica and Barbazoobo were busy taking care of the bats, Daniel and Kaggra have had some time to figure out where to go next. They both agree that there's a magical pull coming from the direction of a group of mausolea, and your best bet is to start heading that way.
>
>*Everyone has rolled so the first Stage has ended, however no one rolled to find out where to head to next. As you want to proceed to the next Stage, you'll have to give this piece of information to the players. That's fine, they don't need to roll for everything. If Barbazoobo had elected to figure out where to go next, a failure on his part could've meant that the bats would start swarming him as well and he'd take damage that way. In the end the Stage is concluded the same and you can proceed on as planned.*
>
>---
>*GM: As you rush off in the direction Daniel and Kaggra have discerned, you quickly dispatch of most of the bats on your way (note: you could've also asked the players to narrate how they fight off the bats without making any rolls or something). As you race past the crooked tombstones, the earth start to move as far as you can see! In the distance, a great number of zombies start to emerge from the ground and slowly. Luckily they're slow and you feel you can easily outrun them. Suddenly, however, the ground around you erupts in a spray of black pungent dirt and shards of carrion. Dozens of grasping, clawing and reaching skeletal arms pry out from underneath you, trying to gain purchase on your feet, ankles and legs. At best they'll keep you in place until the rotting horde of zombies arrive, at worst they'll drag you down into the ground... What do you do?*
>
>---
>**Boudica:** Alright, I'll grab my swords and start swinging at these claws to carve a way through!
>
>**GM:** Well, your arms are a bit fatigued from the previous Stage where you were fighting off the bats. You can try to do this but it would a second attack roll in this Challenge, so the DC will increase by 5 to 20!
>
>**Boudica:** Bah, never mind then. I'll employ my acrobatical proficiency to deftly step, dodge and weave through the tangling mess!
>
>**GM:** Very well, make a DEX check with DC15.
>
>*The roll comes up as a 19 total. A success!*
>
>**GM:** You succeed, want to narrate how you move through this field of grasping bones?
>
>**Boudica:** I take a long leap forward, roll elegantly between two grasping arms and then lightly swerve between the hands, not putting my feet down for longer than an instant!
>
>**GM:** The rest of you see Boudica swiftly dance off, but the hands are clawing more assuredly on your own legs, what do you do?
>
>**Daniel:** I want to blast the ones around me away with my magic!
>
>**GM:** Do you want to use a leveled spell for that (*in other words, a Resource*) or a generic magical effect that you roll for.
>
>**Daniel:** Uhmm, I'll roll for it, and I try to conjure spear of fire to explode the bones all up.
>
>**Barbazoobo:** I don't really have a good idea for what to do myself, because I also don't want to take the +5 DC for attacking, so I'll aid Daniel by lifting him high up so he has a good view.
>
>**GM:** Alright Daniel, roll a spellcasting check with a +2 as Barbazoobo lifts you up on to his neck so you have a clear shot around you.
>
>*The roll comes up as a 7 total. A failure! Because Barbazoobo is throwing his lot in with Daniel by aiding, the negative consequences will also affect him!*
>
>**Daniel and Barbazoobo:** Oh no...
>
>**GM:** Barbazoobo lifts Daniel up, but before Daniel can conjure his magic a number of skeletal hands latch on to Barbazoobo's pants and they start pulling! Barbazoobo loses his balance and topples over, right in the middle of a crowd of skeletal claws! As they grab hold of you and start clawing, you not only feel them cut into your flesh, but also seeping out your life's energy! Please take 4d6 necrotic damage and take a -1 ongoing to your Constitution until you've had a full rest!
>(*There's not really a reason to go extra hard on the party at this point, but sometimes it's good to knock them down a peg from their hero high horse.*)
>
>**Kaggra:** Looks like it's just me left to do something, and I really don't want to take that same punishment! I'll cast Guiding Bolt to disperse the skeletons around me and my friends.
>
>**GM:** Alright, since that's a resource you're spending on this you succeed automatically. Holy energy bursts from your hands and burns away the skeletal claws around you and your friends. Daniel and Barbazoobo quickly picks themselves up as you run after Boudica, Kaggra burning away any new graspers. You run further ahead, drawn to one specific ornate mausoleum from which you can feel the negative energy bursting out from in waves as you get closer.
>(*Note that the actual spell mechanics don't really matter. You don't have to roll damage or stick to the spell's exact description, all that matters is that they used a Resource to succeed and you can take the flavour from the spell to narrate the effect.*)
>
>*As everyone has rolled in the second Stage, it has now ended. Again it's narrated by the GM where they're heading to and why they know to head towards it. There should be a good understanding between GM and players that that is how Skill Challenges work out. It's not necessarily about doing the exact right thing, it's about creating a cool narrative of overcoming a danger.*
>
>---
>*GM: Finally your end goal is in sight: a dark, ominous mausoleum that seems to tower above everything else in this eternal graveyard. Unfortunately you're not alone. From every corner of this dimension a wave of undead zombies has been surging towards you, and they're nearly upon you! The mausoleum is just an arm's length away, and you push against the door... only to find it closed! The zombies are advancing, what do you do?*
>
>---
>**Barbazoobo:** I gather my strength and try to break open the door!
>
>**GM:** Alright, but you can sense that this is not a normal door. This door is wrought with evil magic. This is a hard Task so the DC is 20!
>
>**Boudica:** I'll help my throwing my weight in with Barbazoobo!
>
>**Daniel:** I'll help as well!
>
>**GM:** The door is not big enough for the help of two people to be effective, so only Boudica can help I'm afraid.
>
>**Daniel:** Well, you said evil magic is warding this door, so I'd like to help by trying to counteract the magic that holds this door in place instead of helping to physically open the door.
>
>**GM:** That makes sense I guess, you can help in this way.
>
>**Kaggra:** Can I also help in the same way then? A +6 bonus would be nice!
>
>**GM:** I'm gonna say that adding on to Daniel's magical attempts to help is not going to be very effective or efficient, so you can't help I'm afraid.
>
>**Barbazoobo:** Shall I roll then?
>
>**GM:** Well let's wait to see what Kaggra is doing. This is the climax of the Challenge so it might be fun to see what happens when you both roll at the same time!
>
>**Kaggra:** I'll try to keep the zombie horde at bay then, holding my holy symbol high in the air and sending out waves of holy energy against them. I don't want to spend another Resource so I'll roll for this ok?
>
>**GM:** Perfect. Barbazoobo you roll STR against a DC20 with a +4 bonus from the two sources of help and Kaggra you roll a spellcasting check against a DC15!
>
>*Barbazoobo rolls a total of 20, they just make it! Kaggra unfortunately rolls 13, a failure. The GM asks everyone to pitch in to narrate this climax and they describe Barbazoobo and Boudica frantically ramming the door while Daniel tries to suppress the incantation with his magic. Kaggra sends out waves of holy energy but it's not good enough, a few of the zombies break through and Kaggra takes 4d6 damage from their ripping fingers. The door busts open, however, and the Skill Challenge is complete! The GM explains a dark glass egg sat in the center of the mausoleum and explains that breaking this object will set them free. The GM asks the party how they want to do this, but no roll has to be made: the Challenge is finished so the rest is just flavour and fluff.*

# Travel as a Skill Challenge
A party traveling through mapped and known terrains is not a challenge, and should probably not receive more attention than a quick description or maybe a humorous montage. It becomes a Challenge when the party has to travel through unknown and dangerous lands, or when they're in chase of a quarry. In these situations, you could treat the scene as a specific type of Skill Challenge: the Travel Challenge. 

### Travel Challenge Goals
As usual, decide on what the Goal of the travel is and if it's a Static or Dynamic Goal. Static Goals are simply 'reach the destination', Dynamic Goals are usually 'reach the destination within a certain amount of time' or 'track and catch up to the quarry'.

When there is a Static Goal, the Challenge determines how wearied the party is after they make it through. Possible costs/complications could be the loss of Recovery (signifying fatigue) or an ongoing -1 penalty to PD or MD until a full rest has been had.

Generally when there is a Dynamic Goal and the Goal has some potential danger, you could have these 3 possible outcomes, with the Neutral outcome being the default:
- **Good**: The party reaches the Danger and has the drop on it
- **Neutral**: The party reaches the Danger and nobody has the drop
- **Bad**: The party reaches the Danger but it has the drop on the party

### Travel Challenge Stages
A Travel Challenge should probably not have too many Stages, 1 or 2, as the Environment will generally be the same. Any more Stages would probably draw the Challenge out for too long, but use your best judgement.

### Travel Challenge Tasks
Unlike a regular Skill Challenge, where there are many different Tasks to think of, a Travel Challenge has 2 Travel Tasks that *always* need to be taken up by the party. PCs undertaking these Tasks can't receive aid from other PCs. In addition, these two Tasks must be rolled first in this order.
1. Scouting (DEX/WIS): any good traveling party scouts ahead to check the surroundings and possible ambushes or traps.
2. Navigating (INT/WIS): you need to know where you're going, either by navigating or tracking a quarry.

The PCs who don't take one of the two Travel Tasks can take up any other Task that would be helpful to the trip. Examples include 'Staying Sharp' to watch for dangers, or 'Foraging' in order to keep everyone fed, watered and happy. Depending on the specific travel scenario, other Tasks might be prudent.

### Ending the Travel Challenge
The Travel Challenge ends when the party has reached their destination. Depending on the Goal, take it from there.

---

# Dungeons as a Skill Challenge
Like traveling, exploring a dungeon could also be resolved as a special Skill Challenge. Technically exploring a dungeon is exploring a dangerous and unknown terrain, just on a smaller scale. 

A Dynamic Goal of reaching a dungeon boss might have different outcomes represented by the amount of mooks/adds present in the final fight.

# Social Encounters as a Skill Challenge

# Chases as a Skill Challenge
Goal is to get the Quarry.
Quarry has a Lead, starts at 3-5.
DC+5: Lead -2
DC: Lead -1
<DC: Lead +1 , or +0 with cost
<5DC: Lead +2, or +1 with cost

Chase ends at Lead 0 or 7
