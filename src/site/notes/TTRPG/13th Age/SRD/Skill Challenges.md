A Skill Challenge provides a non-combat mode challenge to the PCs to reach a Goal. Combat may be (narrative) part of the Challenge, but it's resolved in an abstract manner rather than using the regular combat rules. 

For a Skill Challenge to make sense, the PCs must want to reach a certain Goal and there must be one or more Obstacles in their way to reach that goal (either passive or active).

Below is covered how to create the framework of a Skill Challenge, how to build the different Stages and how to finally run and resolve the Challenge.

# Skill Challenge Framework
A Skill Challenge, like any other aspect of a TTRPG, must allow the player agency to undertake the actions that they think their PC would do in the situation. A fully pre-planned Skill Challenge with set checks and rolls only reduces players to glorified dice rollers at the service of the GM's story. That doesn't mean that a GM can't plan any obstacles for them to overcome, but they must be able to adapt the obstacles based on the players' actions.

To help guide this process, it's good to create a framework for a Skill Challenge to work from.

1. Determine the **Goal** of the Challenge?
2. Is the Goal **Static** or **Dynamic**?
3. Is the way to the Goal a **Set Path** or a **Variable Path**?
4. What are the **Environments** the PCs must proceed through on the path?
5. What kind of **Obstacles**, either passive or active, are there in the way of the PCs reaching the Goal?
6. How many **Stages** should the Challenge have?

### Goal
The Goal of a Skill Challenge is where the PCs end up at the end of the Challenge. This can be a physical location, or it can be a situation. Where will they be, or what will they have achieved or influenced?

Examples: Reach the exit of a collapsing dungeon; Influence the decisions of the mayor; Scale the Thunder Bluff Cliffs; Prevent the Warlock King from opening the Demon Portal of Nargoth.

### Static or Dynamic Goals
A Goal can be either Static or Dynamic.
A Static Goal means that the Goal can't be influenced by the PCs actions. No matter in how the PCs go about reaching the Goal, the Goal remains the same. *Reach the exit of a collapsing dungeon* is a Static Goal: The exit is not going anywhere, nor will any tardiness or incompetence of the PCs influence anything other than their own progress. A Static Goal usually means the PCs are the only active party in and around the Challenge.

A Dynamic Goal means that the Goal is subject to the PCs influence. The result of their actions and successes influence how the Goal will play out in the game. *Prevent the Warlock King from opening the Demon Portal* is a Dynamic Goal: The portal may or may not open depending on the PCs progress through the Challenge. If they perform well, the Portal remains closed. If they perform poorly, the Portal opens.

When the Challenge has a Dynamic Goal, it's good to determine how the outcome of the Challenge may be changed by failures and successes of the PCs. This can be as granular as you want it to be, but generally try to aim for 2 or 3 different outcomes (Full Success, (Partial Success), Minimal Success/Failure) and decide what the 'default' outcome is.

### The Path
Like with Goals, there can be a variation in the path the PCs follow from the start of the Challenge to the end. 

A **Set Path** means that there is only one way the PCs can progress through the Challenge to the end. If the PCs set out to *Scale the Thunder Bluff Cliffs*, they can only travel across the cliffs upwards. There may be all kinds of problems and complications along the cliff, but the path they take can't be deviated from. 

A Set Path does not always need to be accompanied by a Static Goal: if the Goal is to *Scale the Thunder Bluff Cliffs unseen*, the Path is Set but the Goal is Dynamic. Set Paths don't allow as much creativity and improvisation from the PCs, but they're easier to create for the GM.

A **Variable Path** means that there are many different ways the PCs can progress through the Challenge. If the PCs attempt to *Influence the mayor's decision*, there are many different ways to do so. The players get to think of and decide how they want to attempt to reach the Goal, each way with their own obstacles to overcome. This determines the narrative the PCs move through to reach the Goal, but it can't change the Goal! 

A Variable Path does not always need to be accompanied by a Dynamic Goal: if the Goal is to *Reach the other side of the Groben Gorge*, the Path is Variable but the Goal is Static.
Variable Paths allow a great amount of freedom to the players but requires more creativity and improvisation from the GM.

### Environment
The Environment of the Challenge is the general, physical location the Challenge will take place in. Depending on the Challenge this can be a single area (the governor's ball) or a number of areas (the Warlock King's tower is set on the perch of a cliff, inside there is a wide atrium filled with magical implements, the staircase leading up is set in the wall, etc.). The Environment is important because it gives the players the fuel for their imagination. Describing a Challenge set in a featureless square room doesn't invite to many antics, but a Challenge set in a square room with metal hooks dangling from the ceiling, barrels of oil stacked in the corner and a large window in the ceiling provides many avenues for the players to think in.

If there is a Set Path, there's only a limited amount of Environments for the GM the think of. With a Variable Path, the GM needs to be prepared for the PCs doing unexpected things. Not everything needs to be written to detail, but the GM should make sure that they have a clear picture of the greater surroundings of the Challenge. 

### Obstacles
The Obstacles are what makes the Challenge a Challenge. Obstacles are passive or active opposition to the PCs from reaching their Goal and must be overcome. Passive Obstacles can be a surging river hindering progress forward, heavy winds buffeting the PCs on a cliff, or a magically locked door that must be opened. Active Obstacles include mostly enemies or other creatures. The GM doesn't need to make a clear distinction between passive and active Obstacles, but they must keep in mind that Active Obstacles can react and respond to the PCs actions. This does not mean anything mechanically, but it does mean that the narrative of the Challenge can change.

In order to account for the unpredictable nature of players, the GM should take care to think of a number of different Obstacles. Defining them loosely also works. That way, the GM can decide on the fly what Obstacle to place in which Environment at a specific part of the Challenge, in response to the actions and behaviour of the PCs. 

If the GM has time to prepare the Skill Challenge, it's always a good idea to already think of a few different ways the PCs could overcome the Obstacles. Well-rounded Obstacles could be overcome in a few different ways, and if a player gets stuck not knowing what to do the GM can make a suggestion.

### Stages
The amount of Stages determines how long the Challenge should take. In a Stage, the PCs are presented with an Environment and one or more Obstacles to overcome. Each PC can contribute to overcoming the Obstacles in the Stage, and the Stage ends when every PC has resolved their action. 

Each Stage should have either a different Environment or different Obstacle than the other ones. If two Stages take place in exactly the same Environment with exactly the same Obstacles, merge them into one Stage. Going through one hallway and overcoming a series of traps only to come into a similar hallway with yet more traps is not very interesting.

Most Challenges will have between 1-3 Stages, depending on how long you want them to last. Short Challenges will have just one Stage, Long Challenges will have three. Going above 3 Stages represent lengthy and epic Challenges that must have an important Goal. Note that the actual amount of Stages might slightly vary if the Challenge has a Variable Path, if the PCs decide to go about it in a roundabout way.

The amount of time a Stage takes is fluid. When traversing a dangerous hallway, each Stage may only represent a number of seconds. When preparing a grand magic ritual, each Stage might represent hours or days worth of time. Stages need not be fully consecutive: you or the players can narrate a montage in between Stages where the PCs progress through a different (or the same) Environment but no Obstacles have to be overcome or rolls are made.

# Running the Challenge
Once the GM has set up the framework of their Skill Challenge - either in preparation or on the fly - they're ready to run the Challenge. In the Challenge the PCs move through the different Stages, Environments and Obstacles in order to reach their Goal.

---

## Moving through Stages
When the PCs enter a Stage of a Challenge, describe the Environment and Obstacles present in the Stage. Be sure to add detail to the Environment to give the players inspiration on how they can overcome the Obstacles. Make it clear if there is a limit to how many PCs can take an action to overcome an Obstacle (a single locked door doesn't invite for many different participants). If it doesn't seem like everyone can contribute to clearing the Obstacles in a Stage, consider adding more Obstacles. 

### Declaring and Resolving Tasks
The action a PC takes to clear an Obstacle is referred to as a Task. Each PC gets to perform a Task to try and overcome the Obstacles in the Stage. Let their imagination run wild: the goal is not for the players to find the exact solution to your Obstacles, but to have their PCs shine in action. If they propose a certain out-there Task to achieve a certain out-there result, allow it and frame the rest of the Stage to accomodate it! If they suggest a feature might be present in the Stage to base a cool Task off, be lenient ('sure, there can be a chandelier on the ceiling to swing from!'). If they want to incorporate a flashback of preparation they might have done earlier, allow that with leniency as well. The PCs can declare their Tasks in whatever order they want. If it makes sense narratively: when one player declares an action that would create new opportunities for other Tasks, they can build on that. If the players can't decide or don't want to decide on an order themselves, let them roll Initiative to decide the order.

When a Task is declared, the GM and player decide on what kind of check is required to complete the Task. Most Tasks will be skill checks. If the Task selected involves taking out opposition by fighting, use an attack roll (condensating combat into a single roll). If a PC with magical capabilities wants to use their magic but not a specific spell (which may be a limited Resource), they can explain what magical effect they want to produce and roll a spellcasting check. Players can also decide to expend one of their limited Resources to fulfill a Task. In this case a roll is not required, they get an automatic success. It's good to inform the players, especially in the case of spells, that the effect of the spells will sometimes not be handled exactly to the letter. Some spells are capable of instantly solving a Challenge if used as written. To avoid this, have a spell grant an effect that's in line with the purpose of the spell, but not verbatim to the spell's text. This may require some negotiation with the player, and if they decide the adapted effect is not worth it, let them retract their choice and go in a different area.

Sometimes not all players can (or have to) think of a separate Task for their PC. In that case they can choose to help another PC instead. If they explain how they help out, the other PC gets a +2 to their roll. Any negative consequences of a failed roll then apply to both PCs. Generally only one PC can help one other, but in some cases - if it makes sense in the narrative - two or more PCs might provide help to a single ally.

Once a player has declared their Task and the type of roll has been decided, the player rolls their dice. After the dice are rolled, the GM compares the results to the DC for the Tasks and narrates the outcome. If wanted, the players can also add to the narrative of the outcome. This process continues until every PC has rolled for a Task or has aided on a Task (so everyone has had a chance to contribute).

The DC for Tasks in the Challenge are based on the environmental tier (13th Age specific, for D&D you can mostly use the Adventurer Tier column, moving up to Champion Tier for higher levels). DCs can be shifted up or down at the GM's discretion. Always communicate the difficulty of a proposed Task to the player before they roll. A failed Tasks doesn't mean no progress is made, but that progress is made at a cost. With a Static Goal the cost is to the PC themselves (damage, resource loss, ongoing penalties), and with a Dynamic Goal the cost can be towards the final outcome. 

##### Task Difficulty 
| Task Difficulty       | Adventurer Tier | Champion Tier | Epic Tier |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Easy**              | DC 10           | DC 15         | DC 20     |
| **Normal** (default)  | DC 15           | DC 20         | DC 25     |
| **Hard**              | DC 20           | DC 25         | DC 30     |
| **Nearly impossible** | DC 25           | DC 30         | DC 35     |

If a PC uses a limited Resource to fulfill their Task, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached.

### Stage Resolution
After every Task has been rolled and the narrative has proceeded, the PCs move on to the next Stage. Always apply failing forward here: the Stage ends after everyone has performed their Task, even if all rolls were a failure. The narrative in which they move on to the next stage might just not look so good, and they'll likely incur some costs/complications. In the case of a Challenge with a Dynamic Goal, a string of failures might negatively affect the final outcome of the Challenge.

### The Next Stage
In the next stage, a new Environment and/or Obstacle is presented to the PCs. If the Challenge has a Variable Path, the next Stage should build on the actions of the previous Stage. After the Stage is set, everyone thinks of their Tasks as before. However: their previous attempts may have wearied them out! If **a player wants to perform a Task that uses an exact same roll they've already employed earlier in the Challenge**, the difficulty of the Task moves up one level (DC+5). This nudges players to think outside of the box, rather than only employ their apex skills or abilties.

---

## Reaching the Goal
When the final Stage of the Challenge has concluded, the PCs reach their Goal.

### Static Goals
In the case of a Static Goal, they achieve just that. The outcome of the different Stages determine whether they suffer any negative consequences while doing so. Any successful roll means the PC accomplished their Task in a Stage without any real difficulty. Any failed roll means the PC accomplished their Task with difficulty or at a cost, such as HP loss, Recovery loss, loss of an item or an ongoing penalty to a specific ability score, attacks or defenses until a next full rest.

### Dynamic Goals
In the case of a Dynamic Goal, the outcome of each Stage influences the final Goal that the players achieve. As a rule of thumb: if **at least half of the Stages are successful**, there is a positive effect on the Goal. The final Goal that is achieved is a culmination of the successes and failures of each Stage. The default Goal (good, neutral or bad) is up to the GM.

##### What determines if a Stage is successful?
To have a Stage be resolved successfully, the PCs have to obtain a score of **more than half** the amount of Tasks performed\. So if a party of 5 PCs decides on performing 4 Tasks (with 1 PC helping another), at least 3 points must be earned for a successful outcome of the Stage. Assign points to the score as follows:

| Outcome of the Task Roll | Points awarded                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DC to DC+4*               | 1 point                                                                            |
| DC+5 or higher           | 2 points                                                                           |
| DC-1 to DC-5             | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a minor cost/complication to the PC (player's choice)                    |
| Lower than DC-5          | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a major cost/complication to the PC (player's choice) |

* As before: if a limited Resource is used, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached (so award 1 point)

Note that, unlike with a Static Goal, a failed roll does not automatically mean a cost or complication. As a failed roll already can negatively contribute to the Dynamic Goal, punishing a PC for a failed roll as well is unfair. However, if needed to complete a Stage successfully, a player with a failed roll can always choose to take a cost/complication in order to add a point to the score. This might pose interesting dilemmas for the player who first declares their Task if they roll a failure, as they won't know how the rest will perform!

## Ending the Challenge
After all the Stages of the Challenge have been completed, present the Goal that they have accomplished. With a Static Goal this is just the only outcome. With a Dynamic Goal, tally up the successful and failed Stages to determine the final outcome.

# Example 1
The following is an example of a Skill Challenge with a Static Goal and a Set Path. This combination of Goal and Path does not allow for a lot of player freedom, so the context in which such a Challenge is put is important. In this case, the Skill Challenge is actually part of an important battle against one of the Lich Queen's high generals. Halfway through the fight, the enemy has trapped the party - Consisting of Boudica the Rogue, Barbazoobo the Bard, Daniel the Wizard and Kaggra the Cleric - in a cursed item that sends them to a pocket dimension graveyard where all manner of undead horrors and terrors will continue assailing them until they break the item from within!

To resolve this scene, the GM decides to run it as a Skill Challenge. 
- The Goal is to *Break free from the pocket dimension*. This is a Static Goal: the only thing the PCs actions influence is how banged up they get while doing so.
- The Path is Set: the GM determines that they can break free by destroying an item in the pocket dimension. While technically they can get to the item in a couple of ways, it's not free enough to call it Variable. 
- The Environment is the pocket dimension graveyard, but to change things up a bit the GM decides that the cursed object is located in an ornate mausoleum.
- The GM thinks of a few thematic Obstacles: a horde of rotting zombies, clawing skeletal hands reaching up from the ground, corpse bats might fly in the air, the door to the mausoleum might be locked, and the item itself might also prove a hazard on its own.
- Finally the length of the Challenge. Considering it's part of an epic battle and the fact that the PCs are relatively good on health and resources, the GM makes this a 3 Stage Challenge. The Path is set as follows:
	1. Get to the mausoleum
	2. Break the door of the mausoleum
	3. Destroy the object

With this framework set up, the GM is ready to run the Challenge! She explains to the players that the next scene will play out like a Skill Challenge, and goes over the rules: she'll set the scene for a Stage, and then everyone gets a chance to do something to advance their position in that scene.

>[!quote]- Example of a Skill Challenge with a Static Goal
>*GM: You find yourself jerked away from the Throne Room and suddenly falling through the empty void of interplanar space. With a dull thud you suddenly smack on slimy, wet grass. When you look around you, you notice a pitch black sky, yet there seems to be an ambient light around without an apparent source. The place you find yourself in brings a shiver to your spine. In the widespread ground covered in mulch and long, unkept grass you see broken tombstones jutting out of the ground in all angles like crooked, jagged teeth. In the distance you notice some buildings with ghoulish stone guardians in front of the doors - mausoleums. The air is filled with a thick, cloying scent of rot and decay.* 
>
>*You gather yourselves up and take stock of your situation. It seems you have been transported to some deadly environment. Just when you start thinking about how you're going to get out of this place - certainly this must be some magical effect the Undead General has put on you - you hear a screech in the air, quickly joined by hundreds of other screeches. The flapping of leathery torn wings on the air. A swarm of gauntly bats are making their way to you!*
>
>*Daniel, as the group's Wizard it's easy for you to realize that the obsidian gem the General raised in the sky must have been a pocket dimension that you have been drawn into. You know that there's only one way to get out: find the same object in this pocket dimension and manipulate it somehow to release yourself! Luckily you're trained enough to feel pulses of dimensional energy coming out of one of the mausoleums further away. There's just a lot of ground in between. Ground that starts to suddenly tremble, shake and move! In the distance, a great number of zombies start to emerge from the ground, slowly but surely pulling their rotting husks from their shallow graves. A croaking of wet groans permeates the air. Luckily they appear to be a bit slow and you feel you can easily outrun them... probably. Your goal is to get to the item and find a way to release yourselves without getting ripped to shreds by these undead! (It's good to specify the situation and the goal to the players, so there's no confusion about what the Challenge is about.) What do you do?*
>
>(*Note that the GM has already given the information as to what the goal is and how to get there. You don't want a stalemate situation where the players just run around aimlessly without trying to figure out what it actually is that they're supposed to be doing. This might be different with a Dynamic Goal or a Variable Path!*)
>
>---
>**Daniel:** Alright, I explain to my friends what's up and where we need to go, and I guess we just start heading there?
>
>**GM:** That's fine, you start running in the direction of the Nexus, the zombies are still coming out of the ground but that swarm of corpse bats that you heard earlier is quickly advancing on you. 
>
>**Boudica:** I don't want to have this swarm on my back, so I just want to fire my crossbow at them to kill or scare them off or something.
>
>**GM:** Ok, make an attack roll to signify your assault on these creatures.
>
>*The roll comes up as a 17 total. The GM had set this as a normal difficulty with a DC15, so the roll has succeeded!*
>
>**GM:** Boudica you fire bolt after bolt into the swarm of bats, and you definitely drop a bunch of them from the sky, but then you suddenly feel something trying to grab your ankle! A skeletal claw has reached up from the ground and its sharp nails are seeking warm flesh to dig into! In a matter of second, more and more skeletal arms and claws start emerging from the ground around you, and it's quickly becoming a mine field of grasping and clawing bones! The zombies may be slow, but if you're held in place here they'll reach you soon enough... What do you do?
>(*The GM thought that having everyone just fire attacks at the bats is probably a bit boring, so they decided to throw a second Obstacle in this Stage. If Boudica had failed her roll, she probably would have taken some damage from these claws.*)
>
>**Boudica:** Can I dodge out of the way of the claws?
>
>**GM:** No, you've already had your action for this Stage, so it's up to the rest to do something now to see how things go for you.
>
>**Daniel:** I want to blast those claws away with my magic!
>
>**GM:** Do you want to use a leveled spell for that (*in other words, a Resource*) or a generic magical effect that you roll for.
>
>**Daniel:** Uhmm, I'll roll for it, and I try to conjure spears of fire to explode the bones all up.
>
>**Barbazoobo:** I don't really have a good idea for what to do myself, so I'll aid Daniel by lifting him high up so he has a good view.
>
>**GM:** Alright Daniel, roll a spellcasting check with a +2 as Barbazoobo lifts you up on to his neck so you have a clear shot around you.
>
>*The roll comes up as a 9 total. A failure! Because Barbazoobo is throwing his lot in with Daniel by aiding, the negative consequences will also affect him!*
>
>**Daniel and Barbazoobo:** Oh no...
>
>**GM:** Barbazoobo lifts Daniel up, but before Daniel can conjure his magic a number of skeletal hands latch on to Barbazoobo's pants and they start pulling! Barbazoobo loses his balance and topples over, right in the middle of a crowd of skeletal claws! As they grab hold of you and start clawing, you not only feel them cut into your flesh, but also seeping out your life's energy! Please take 4d6 necrotic damage and take a -1 ongoing to your Constitution until you've had a full rest!
>(*You can adjust any damage or other penalties according to the party's level, current situation and the danger of the Challenge.*)
>
>**Kaggra:** Looks like it's just me left to do something, and I really don't want to take that same punishment! I'll cast Guiding Bolt to disperse the skeletons around me and my friends.
>
>**GM:** Alright, since that's a resource you're spending on this you succeed automatically. Holy energy bursts from your hands and burns away the skeletal claws around you and your friends. Daniel and Barbazoobo quickly picks themselves up and you can run clear of this danger, with Kaggra burning away any new graspers. You run further ahead, drawn to one specific ornate mausoleum from which you can feel the negative energy bursting out from in waves as you get closer.
>(*Note that the actual spell mechanics don't really matter. You don't have to roll damage or stick to the spell's exact description, all that matters is that they used a Resource to succeed and you can take the flavour from the spell to narrate the effect.*)
>
>*Now everyone has rolled, so the first Stage has ended. They managed to get rid of the skeletal arms, but the corpse bats might still pose an Obstacle in later stages. If Kaggra hadn't successfully blasted them off, the narrative probably would have been that more damage would be sustained, but that the group would have extracted themselves with difficulty in the end. There's no sense in lingering on the same Obstacle until someone rolls a success, we try to fail forward.*
>
>---
>*GM: Finally your goal is in sight: a dark, ominous mausoleum that seems to tower above everything else in this eternal graveyard. Unfortunately you're not alone. From every corner of this dimension a wave of undead zombies has been surging towards you, and they're nearly upon you! Behind you you also hear the incessant fluttering of the corpse bats as their swam swell to grotesque sizes. The mausoleum is just an arm's length away, and you push against the door... only to find it closed! The zombies and bats are advancing, what do you do?*
>
>---
>**Barbazoobo:** I gather my strength and try to break open the door!
>
>**GM:** Alright, but you can sense that this is not a normal door. This door is wrought with evil magic. This is a hard Task so the DC is 20!
>
>**Boudica:** I'll help my throwing my weight in with Barbazoobo!
>
>**Daniel:** I'll help as well!
>
>**GM:** The door is not big enough for the help of two people to be effective, so only Boudica can help I'm afraid.
>
>**Daniel:** Well, you said evil magic is warding this door, so I'd like to help by trying to counteract the magic that holds this door in place instead of helping to physically open the door.
>
>**GM:** That makes sense I guess, you can help in this way.
>
>**Kaggra:** Can I also help in the same way then? A +6 bonus would be nice!
>
>**GM:** I'm gonna say that adding on to Daniel's magical attempts to help is not going to be very effective or efficient, so you can't help I'm afraid.
>
>**Barbazoobo:** Shall I roll then?
>
>**GM:** Well let's wait to see what Kaggra is doing first. The zombies are nearly upon you so let's see how the narrative resolves.
>
>**Kaggra:** I'll try to keep the zombie horde at bay then, holding my holy symbol high in the air and sending out waves of holy energy against them. I don't want to spend another Resource so I'll roll for this ok?
>
>**GM:** Perfect. Kaggra you roll first to see how you're keeping the zombies at bay while the rest gets ready for the door. Roll a spellcasting check against a DC15!
>
>*Kaggra rolls very well and gets a total of 23! That's quite a bit higher than the DC15 difficulty, but as this is a Challenge with a Static Goal, this extreme success doesn't bring anything extra in.*
>
>**GM:** Kaggra sends out waves of holy energy to keep the undead at bay, giving the rest of you time and space to focus on the door! Daniel has prepared his counter-incantation and Barbazoobo and Boudica fling themselves at the door. Barbazoobo please roll STR against a DC20 with a +4 bonus from the two sources of help!
>
>*Barbazoobo rolls a total of 20, they just make it! Everyone has added something to this Stage, so this Stage is now also concluded: quite a lot faster than the first one! Note that if any or both rolls had failed, the narrative probably would have been that it had taken them too long to open the door and the zombies would have gotten some attacks in.*
>
>---
>*GM: As Kaggra is still keeping out the undead, Barbazoobo and Boudica throw their collective weight against the door as Daniel tries to suppress its evil magic. The door bursts open in a sickening groan and you find yourselves in a small chamber of black marble. In its center is a small dais with a purple gem: the Nexus! You'll have to figure out how to use it to release yourselves from here, but before you can do anything a large window in the ceiling bursts and shattered glass rains down on you! The corpse bats have reappeared and they're quickly filling up this room with their diseased bodies and burning spittle. What do you do?*
>
>**Daniel:** I guess I'll try to study it to see if I can manipulate it to bring us back?
>
>**Kaggra:** Can I help?
>
>**GM:** How would you help him with his studies?
>
>**Kaggra:** Well I have some magical knowledge myself, I can act as a soundboard or we can brainstorm together maybe?
>
>**GM:** Sounds legit, you can aid but let's first see what the rest wants to do. It's the climax of the Challenge so it might be fun to all roll simultaneously at the end! The bats are swarming all around this place and the zombies that were first held at bay are also making their way into the mausoleum, so Boudica and Barbazoobo: what do you do?
>
>**Boudica:** I'll get on those damned bats again with my crossbow!
>
>**GM:** You've already made an attack roll earlier this Challenge, so that's going to be a bit more difficult than it was! Your arms may be tired, or you're running out of ammo. Whatever it is, the DC increases by 5 to 20!
>
>**Boudica:** Never mind then, I don't like those odds. Can I distract the bats away from Daniel and Kaggra so they can work in peace? Like I make myself the most likely target and then kite them around?
>
>**GM:** Yeah definitely. Do you want to roll CHA to make yourself a good target or DEX to avoid their attacks?
>(*The GM offers a choice of rolls here. That's always nice to do, because a bad ability score shouldn't be in the way of a cool idea. Usually you could think of several ability scores to apply to one problem, so offer the players a choice when you can. Also note that, as INT is usually quite underappreciated, you can always ask for an INT roll if you think the player has a clever plan or uses quick thinking.*)
>
>**Boudica:** I'm better at DEX so I'll roll that.
>
>**Barbazoobo:** That leaves me with the zombies. I will try to hold the zombies at the door at bay!
>
>**GM:** How do you want to do that? Attack them with your weapons or physically block them with STR or CON?
>
>**Barbazoobo:** I'll just hit them with my spear with an attack roll.
>
>**GM:** Ok, so Daniel and Kaggra are working on the Nexus while Boudica tries to distract the bats away from them and Barbazoobo will hold the zombies at bay, everyone roll!
>
>*Daniel, with Kaggra's help, only rolls a 13! Boudica and Barbazoobo both attain successes with their rolls. Everyone has rolled and this was the last Stage, so the Challenge will end now - even though Daniel and Kaggra failed their roll. Fail forward: they get out, but at a cost! The GM, tired of exhaustive descriptions, asks the players of Boudica and Barbazoobo to narrate their successes. Then he tells Daniel and Kaggra that they've managed to activate the Nexus, but that they did it wrong somehow, and asks for suggestions as to what complication might occur. Daniel and Kaggra think for a second and decide that not only did they transport themselves out of the pocket dimension, some of the zombies were transported along as well! That sounds fun, the GM agrees.*
>
>**GM:** After another jerky trip through interplanar space, you find yourselves where you disappeared from: the Lich Queen's Throne Room! The Undead General stares at the broken Nexus in his hands with malice, and he draws his sword to take care of you once and for all. Behind him, the shapes of 6 zombies that have traveled with you rise up as well. Everyone roll Initiative again, it's time for the second half of this encounter!

# Example 2
The following is an example of a Skill Challenge with a Dynamic Goal and a Variable Path. This allows the players a lot of freedom in approaching the Goal, but may require more confidence and improvisation from the GM. In this Challenge, Boudica, Barbazoobo, Daniel and Kaggra have found themselves chasing an Evil Conjurer in a small mining town. They know the Conjurer is about to open a portal to the Netherrealm to summon a flock of imps to his side, and they want to prevent that from happening and put a stop to him for once and all! The only problem is that they don't know where he's hiding.

The GM knows the confrontation with the Conjurer will be a proper combat, but the way there is expedited as a Skill Challenge.
- The Goal is to *Find the Conjurer before he manages to open the portal*. This is a Dynamic Goal: there's someone else involved and the actions and successes of the party can influence to what extent the Conjurer reaches his goal.
- The Path is Variable: the GM has decided that the portal site is in an abandoned basement in a town, and the PCs don't know which building it is. There are many different ways they could go about this, and it's unpredictable how the party will proceed.
- The Environment is the town. The GM decides that it's a poor town with many unemployed people on the streets, and small and dark alleyways filled with thugs. 
- Because the GM doesn't know how the party will go about it, she'll have to decide on a number of different Obstacles that may come into play. Townsfolk who will want to be paid for their information can be an Obstacle, the tracks the Conjurer has left may be hard to spot, and when the Conjurer gets closer to his goal, all kinds of magical mishaps may start occuring!
- Considering that the GM doesn't want to detract attention away from the main fight for too long and she doesn't want to wear the party out too much before the grand finale, she settles on a 2 Stage Challenge. She imagines that Stage 1 will be looking for clues and Stage 2 will be trying to break into the house of the Conjurer, but given that it's a Variable Path this is not set in stone.

Considering it's a Dynamic Goal, the GM thinks of 3 possible outcomes: one positive outcome, a neutral outcome and a negative outcome. She decides that the outcome influences how many imps fight alongside the Conjurer in the battle. 
- In a neutral outcome - which will be the default - there will be some imps helping the Conjurer. 
- In the good outcome, which will occur if the party succeeds on both Stages, there will be only one or two imps. 
- In the bad outcome, which will occur if the party fails both Stages, there will be some imps helping the Conjurer, and some more showing up later in the battle (*staggering mooks like this prevents the party from being overwhelmed from the beginning while still presenting a harder fight than usual*)!

With this framework set up, the GM is ready to run the Challenge! She explains to the players that the next scene will play out like a Skill Challenge, and goes over the rules: she'll set the scene for a Stage, and then everyone gets a chance to do something to advance their position in that scene. If they fail their Task, they have a choice of either not contributing to the success of the Stage, or incurring a cost or penalty for themselves!

>[!quote]- Example of a Skill Challenge with a Dynamic Goal
>*GM: You have followed the tracks of the Conjurer to the mountain town of Krezlen. You know he is close to opening a portal to the Netherrealm, and he's probably chosen this town to do it in. The only problem is, you don't know where he's hiding out!*
>
>*The town itself looks dreary. Once this was probably a more prosperous mining town, but the years have not been kind. Unemployed workers linger on the streets, playing games of chance or simply smoking and staring off into the distance. Children play with sticks and broken barrels. A slow rain starts to fall.*
>
>*It's up to you to try and find the Conjurer before he manages to open the portal and destroy this town, and probably more. This will be run as a Skill Challenge, and your successes and failures will determine the outcome. What do you do?*
>
>---
>**Daniel:** Well that's easy, I cast Locate Person!
>
>**GM:** You confidently cast your spell, but you notice some strange interference. You definitely sense that the Conjurer is in this town, and you're even able to narrow it down to the northern side of town. Any more detail can't be gleaned, unfortunately. It seems the magics he is working are blurring your divinations!
>*A stingy player could start balking and quoting the exact text for Locate Person. Remind them that this is how things can go in a Skill Challenge, and offer them to retcon their action if they didn't want to spend the Resource. As it is, the use of this spell has earned the group a point for this Stage.*
>
>**Boudica:** Alright, I'll head to the part of town the spell identified and I'll start asking around. I know how to move along the downtrodden of society and I'll employ my street smarts.
>
>**GM:** Cool, roll me a CHA with DC15.
>
>**Barbazoobo:** I'll help by playing a sad ballad while Boudica is talking!
>
>*Boudica rolls CHA with a +2 bonus from Barbazoobo's aid, and gets a 21. That's a high enough result to earn 2 points for this Stage!*
>
>**GM:** The men you talk to quickly warm to your demeanor, and though they don't know exactly where the Conjurer is, they do know that some strange noises have been heard a few blocks away.
>Kaggra, you're left in this Stage, is there anything you want to do?
>
>**Kaggra:** I can't really think of anything...
>
>**Daniel:** Well, since my spell was distorted by weird interference, maybe you can see if you can open yourself up to that feeling and see where it emanates from?
>
>**Kaggra:** Yeah that sounds good, I'll roll spellcasting then!
>
>*The roll comes up as 12, not enough unfortunately!*
>
>**GM:** Kaggra, you try to feel the vibes but you're unable to really use them to pinpoint anything. You're not contributing to the success of this Stage right now, but if you want to you could try to open up yourself a bit more to the energies. You'll incur some damage but you'll be adding a point to this Stage.
>
>**Kaggra:** Well we already have 2 points from Daniel's spell en Boudica's talking, and as we've rolled for 3 Tasks it means we already have enough points (*more than half of the amount of Tasks rolled*) to succeed so I'll just leave it.
>
>---
>*Now for the second Stage of this Challenge. It seems the party has already discerned enough directions to be close to the Conjurer, so to have another Stage revolving around figuring out what's up seems a bit pointless. The GM decides that the Conjurer has probably set up some defenses, and that the ritual must be nearing its end, so it's time to throw some active opposition against the party! To raise the stakes and tension, the GM sets the DC for this environment at 20 and communicates this clearly to the players.*
>
>**GM:** You head in the direction specified by the gentlemen of this town, and you feel you must be getting closer. Arcane energies are starting to pulse through the air. At first it's just tangible, but then it suddenly intensifies and crackling bolts of magic start to fire in the air around you. If you're not careful, you'll get hit by one of the blasts! What do you do?
>
>**Daniel:** Can I attempt to use my magic to divert the energy away from us?
>
>**GM:** Yeah, roll a spellcasting check!
>
>*Daniel only rolls a 6! That's a great failure, so Daniel will have the choice to not contribute to this Stage or to do so but suffer a major consequence. The GM offers Daniel this choice.*
>
>**Daniel:** Ehhhh, I'd rather not take any damage or something. I'll just hope that the rest will perform well enough to succeed here!
>
>**GM:** Alright, Daniel you manage to divert the magic energy away from your party, but in doing so you've disturbed some magical energies and everything becomes very disorientating, left feels right, up looks like down, it's going to be hard to find your way!
>
>**Kaggra:** I'd like to call upon my divine magic to see the true way!
>
>**GM:** You already rolled a spellcasting check this Challenge, so if you want to do so again the DC will go up by 5. As the DC is already 20, that'd be a DC25 check!
>
>**Kaggra:** Ugggh fine, I'll look for the right way like a normal non-magical person.
>
>**Boudica:** I'll help!
>
>*The GM offers Kaggra the choice between INT and WIS. Kaggra has higher WIS so that's the obvious choice. Even with a +2 from Boudica, the result is only 16! Another failure!*
>
>**Kaggra:** Noooooooooooo
>
>**GM:** That's 2 failures. The Stage can still be a success if Barbazoobo rolls well enough to get 2 points (*again 3 Tasks will be made this Stage, and more than half of that number in points is required for a success*)
>
>**Barbazoobo:** I'll use my charisma to pump everyone up to just carry on and find this guy!
>
>*Barbazoobo rolls CHA, and gets a 24. A success, but not good enough for 2 points. This Stage has failed.*
>
>**Everyone:** Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
>
>**GM:** Bravely you power on, but you've lost some time finding your way. You hear a crackling sounds in the distance and the door of one of the houses blows out. A violent crack appears in the sky as the portal is very close to opening! You finally see the Conjurer appear, still concentrating on wrenching the portal further open. It seems he's not yet completed his endeavour, but a few imps are slipping through the cracks. It's time to put a stop to him once and for all, roll Initiative!
