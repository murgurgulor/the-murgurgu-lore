A Skill Challenge provides a non-combat mode challenge to the PCs to reach a Goal. Combat may be (narrative) part of the Challenge, but it's resolved in an abstract manner rather than using the regular combat rules. 

For a Skill Challenge to make sense, the PCs must want to reach a certain Goal and there must be one or more Obstacles in their way to reach that goal (either passive or active).

Below is covered how to create the framework of a Skill Challenge, how to build the different Stages and how to finally run and resolve the Challenge.

# Skill Challenge Framework
- Determine the Goal of the Challenge (where do the PCs want to be or what do they want to have achieved)?
- Is the Goal Static or Dynamic?
	- Static: there are no other limiting factors (time, efficiency) besides the Obstacles to reaching the Goal. No matter how long it takes the PCs to achieve the Goal, the Goal remains the same. For example: scaling a large cliff wall to reach the top without the need for speed or stealth.
	- Dynamic: there are limiting factors besides the Obstacles that can alter the degree of success upon reaching the Goal. If the PCs don't resolve the Challenge in a specific time or manner, the Goal might change. For example: making your way through a gauntlet in time to prevent a wizard from setting off a spell. Complete success means the spell is fully prevented, partial success means the brunt of the spell is prevented but the wizard has achieved some effect, failure means the spell gets set off.
		- If there is a Dynamic Goal, determine how the outcome of the Challenge may be changed by failures and successes of the PCs. This can be as granular as you want it to be, but try to aim for 2 or 3 different outcomes (Full Success, (Partial Success), Minimal Success/Failure) and decide what the 'default' outcome is.
- What are the Environments the PCs must proceed through in order to achieve their Goal?
- What kind of Obstacles, either passive or active, are there in the Environment that hinder the PCs reaching their Goal?

# Building the Challenge
## Setting Stages
Once the Framework has been established, determine how long the Challenge should take. This decides how many Stages the Challenge has. Each Stage must have either a different Environment or different Obstacle than the other ones. If two Stages take place in exactly the same Environment with exactly the same Obstacles, merge them into one Stage. Going through one hallway and overcoming a series of traps only to come into a similar hallway with yet more traps is not very interesting.

Most Challenges have between 1-3 Stages, depending on how long you want them to last. Short Challenges will have just one Stage, Long Challenges will have three. Going above 3 Stages represent lengthy and epic Challenges that must have an important Goal.

The amount of time a Stage takes is fluid. When traversing a dangerous hallway, each Stage may only represent a number of seconds. When preparing a grand magic ritual, each Stage might represent hours or days worth of time. Stages need not be fully consecutive: you can narrate a montage in between Stages where the PCs progress through a different (or the same) Environment but no Obstacles are overcome or rolls are made.

# Running the Challenge

---

## Moving through Stages
When the PCs enter a Stage of a Challenge, describe the Environment and Obstacles present in the Stage. Be sure to add detail to the Environment to give the players inspiration on how they can overcome the Obstacles. Make it clear if there is a limit to how many PCs can take an action to overcome the Stage. Three distinctions are:
- Only 1 PC can make a single unassisted check
- A specific number of PCs can make a check, and others can provide help
- All PCs can make a check

### Declaring and Resolving Tasks
Each PC gets to perform a Task to try and overcome the Obstacles in the Stage. Let their imagination run wild. If they suggest a feature might be present in the Stage to base a cool Task off, be lenient ('sure, there can be a chandelier on the ceiling to swing from!'). If they want to incorporate a flashback of preparation they might have done earlier, allow that with leniency as well. The PCs can declare their Tasks in whatever order they want, but they get resolved simultaneously at the end. If it makes sense narratively, if one player declares an action that would create new opportunities for other Tasks, they can build on that.

When a Task is declared, the GM and player decide on what kind of check is required to complete the Task. Most Tasks will be skill checks. If the Task selected involves taking out opposition by fighting, use an attack roll (condensating combat into a single roll). If a PC with magical capabilities wants to use their magic but not a specific spell (which may be a limited resource), they can explain what magical effect they want to produce and roll their spellcasting modifier+lvl. Players can also decide to expend one of their limited Resources to fulfill a Task. In this case a roll is not required, they get an automatic success.

Sometimes not all players can (or have to) think of a separate action for their PC. In that case they can choose to help another PC instead. If they explain how they help out, the other PC gets a +2 to their roll. Any negative consequences of a failed roll then apply to both PCs. Generally only one PC can help one other, but in some cases - if it makes sense in the narrative - two or more PCs might provide help to a single ally.

Once everyone has declared their Tasks and decided on the roll, the players roll their dice in the order that makes sense in the narrative. After the dice are rolled, the GM compares the results to the DC for the Tasks and narrates the outcome. If wanted, the players can also add to the narrative of the outcome. 

The DC for Tasks in the Challenge are based on the environmental tier. DCs can be shifted up or down at the GM's discretion. Always communicate the difficulty of a proposed Task to the player before they roll. Failed Tasks almost always come with a cost or complication to the PC (HP loss, resource loss, ongoing penalty to a certain ability or attacks).

##### Task Difficulty 
| Task Difficulty       | Adventurer Tier | Champion Tier | Epic Tier |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Easy**              | DC 10           | DC 15         | DC 20     |
| **Normal** (default)  | DC 15           | DC 20         | DC 25     |
| **Hard**              | DC 20           | DC 25         | DC 30     |
| **Nearly impossible** | DC 25           | DC 30         | DC 35     |

If a PC uses a limited Resource to fulfill their Task, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached.

### Stage Resolution
After every Tasks has been rolled and the narrative has proceeded, the PCs move on to the next stage. Always apply failing forward here: the Stage ends after everyone has performed their Task, even if all rolls were a failure. The narrative in which they move on to the next stage might just not look so good, and they'll likely incur some costs/complications. In the case of a Challenge with a Dynamic Goal, a string of failures might negatively affect the final outcome of the Challenge.

### The Next Stage
In the next stage, a new Environment and/or Obstacle is presented to the PCs. Everyone thinks of their Tasks as before. However, their previous attempts may have wearied them out. If a player wants to handle a Task with an exact roll they've already employed earlier in the Challenge, the difficulty of the Task moves up one level (DC+5).

## Reaching the Goal
When the final Stage of the Challenge has concluded, the PCs reach their Goal.

### Static Goals
In the case of a Static Goal, they achieve just that. The outcome of the different Stages determine whether they suffer any negative consequences while doing so. Any successful roll means the PC accomplished their Task in a Stage without any real difficulty. Any failed roll means the PC accomplished their Task with difficulty or at a cost, such as HP loss, Recovery loss, loss of an item or an ongoing penalty to a specific ability score, attacks or defenses until a next full rest.

### Dynamic Goals
In the case of a Dynamic Goal, the outcome of each Stage influences the final Goal that the players achieve. As a rule of thumb: if **at least half of the Stages are successful**, there is a positive effect on the Goal. The final Goal that is achieved is a culmination of the successes and failures of each Stage. The default Goal (good, neutral or bad) is up to the GM.

#### What determines if a Stage is successful?
To have a Stage be resolved successfully, the PCs have to obtain a score of **more than half** the amount of Tasks performed\. So if a party of 5 PCs decides on performing 4 Tasks (with 1 PC helping another), at least 3 points must be earned for a successful outcome of the Stage. Assign points to the score as follows:

| Outcome of the Task Roll | Points awarded                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DC to DC+4*               | 1 point                                                                            |
| DC+5 or higher           | 2 points                                                                           |
| DC-1 to DC-5             | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a minor cost/complication to the PC (player's choice)                    |
| Lower than DC-5          | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a major cost/complication to the PC (player's choice) |

* As before: if a limited Resource is used, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached (so award 1 point)

Note that, unlike with a Static Goal, a failed roll does not automatically mean a cost or complication. As a failed roll already can negatively contribute to the Dynamic Goal, punishing a PC for a failed roll as well is unfair. However, if needed to complete a successful Stage, a player with a failed roll can always choose to take a cost/complication in order to add a point to the score.

## Ending the Challenge
After all the Stages of the Challenge have been completed, present the Goal that they have accomplished. With a Static Goal this is just the only outcome. With a Dynamic Goal, tally up the successful and failed Stages to determine the final outcome.
