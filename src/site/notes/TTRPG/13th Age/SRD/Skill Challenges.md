A Skill Challenge provides a non-combat mode challenge to the PCs to reach a Goal. Combat may be (narrative) part of the Challenge, but it's resolved in an abstract manner rather than using the regular combat rules. 

For a Skill Challenge to make sense, the PCs must want to reach a certain Goal and there must be one or more Obstacles in their way to reach that goal (either passive or active).

Below is covered how to create the framework of a Skill Challenge, how to build the different Stages and how to finally run and resolve the Challenge.

# Skill Challenge Framework
A Skill Challenge, like any other aspect of a TTRPG, must allow the player agency to undertake the actions that they think their PC would do in the situation. A fully pre-planned Skill Challenge with set checks and rolls only reduces players to glorified dice rollers at the service of the GM's story. That doesn't mean that a GM can't plan any obstacles for them to overcome, but they must be able to adapt the obstacles based on the players' actions.

To help guide this process, it's good to create a framework for a Skill Challenge to work from.

1. Determine the **Goal** of the Challenge?
2. Is the Goal **Static** or **Dynamic**?
3. Is the way to the Goal a **Set Path** or a **Variable Path**?
4. What are the **Environments** the PCs must proceed through on the path?
5. What kind of **Obstacles**, either passive or active, are there in the way of the PCs reaching the Goal?
6. How many **Stages** should the Challenge have?

### Goal
The Goal of a Skill Challenge is where the PCs end up at the end of the Challenge. This can be a physical location, or it can be a situation. Where will they be, or what will they have achieved or influenced?

Examples: Reach the exit of a collapsing dungeon; Influence the decisions of the mayor; Scale the Thunder Bluff Cliffs; Prevent the Warlock King from opening the Demon Portal of Nargoth.

### Static or Dynamic Goals
A Goal can be either Static or Dynamic.
A Static Goal means that the Goal can't be influenced by the PCs actions. No matter in how the PCs go about reaching the Goal, the Goal remains the same. Any success or failure only affects the PCs. *Reach the exit of a collapsing dungeon* is a Static Goal: The exit is not going anywhere, nor will any tardiness or incompetence of the PCs influence anything other than their own progress. A Static Goal usually (but not always) means the PCs are the only active party in and around the Challenge.

A Dynamic Goal means that the Goal itself is subject to the PCs influence. The result of their actions and successes influence how the Goal will play out in the game. *Prevent the Warlock King from opening the Demon Portal* is a Dynamic Goal: The portal may or may not open depending on the PCs progress through the Challenge. If they perform well, the Portal remains closed. If they perform poorly, the Portal opens.

When the Challenge has a Dynamic Goal, it's good to determine how the outcome of the Challenge may be changed by failures and successes of the PCs. This can be as granular as you want it to be, but generally try to aim for 2 or 3 different outcomes (Full Success, (Partial Success), Minimal Success/Failure) and decide what the 'default' outcome is.


### Environment
The Environment of the Challenge is the general, physical location the Challenge will take place in. Depending on the Challenge this can be a single area (the governor's ball) or a number of areas (the Warlock King's tower is set on the perch of a cliff, inside there is a wide atrium filled with magical implements, the staircase leading up is set in the wall, etc.). The Environment is important because it gives the players the fuel for their imagination. Describing a Challenge set in a featureless square room doesn't invite to many antics, but a Challenge set in a square room with metal hooks dangling from the ceiling, barrels of oil stacked in the corner and a large window in the ceiling provides many avenues for the players to think in. Not everything needs to be written to detail, but the GM should make sure that they have a clear picture of the greater surroundings of the Challenge. 

### Obstacles
The Obstacles are what makes the Challenge a Challenge. Obstacles are passive or active opposition to the PCs from reaching their Goal and must be overcome. Passive Obstacles can be a surging river hindering progress forward, heavy winds buffeting the PCs on a cliff, or a magically locked door that must be opened. Active Obstacles include mostly enemies or other creatures. The GM doesn't need to make a clear distinction between passive and active Obstacles, but they must keep in mind that Active Obstacles can react and respond to the PCs actions. This does not mean anything mechanically, but it does mean that the narrative of the Challenge can change.

In order to account for the unpredictable nature of players, the GM should take care to think of a number of different Obstacles. Defining them loosely also works. That way, the GM can decide on the fly what Obstacle to place in which Environment at a specific part of the Challenge, in response to the actions and behaviour of the PCs. 

If the GM has time to prepare the Skill Challenge, it's always a good idea to already think of a few different ways the PCs could overcome the Obstacles. Well-rounded Obstacles could be overcome in a few different ways, and if a player gets stuck not knowing what to do the GM can make a suggestion. Don't lock an Obstacle down to be overcome is only a few ways: if the players suggest something wildly outlandish, try to make it work with them! 

### Stages
The amount of Stages determines how long the Challenge should take. In a Stage, the PCs are presented with an Environment and one or more Obstacles to overcome. Each PC can contribute to overcoming the Obstacles in the Stage, and the Stage ends when every PC has resolved their action. 

Each Stage should have either a different Environment or different Obstacle than the other ones. If two Stages take place in exactly the same Environment with exactly the same Obstacles, merge them into one Stage. Going through one hallway and overcoming a series of traps only to come into a similar hallway with yet more traps is not very interesting.

Most Challenges will have between 1-3 Stages, depending on how long you want them to last. Short Challenges will have just one Stage, Long Challenges will have three. Going above 3 Stages represent lengthy and epic Challenges that must have an important Goal. 

Sometimes, the amount of Stages might vary if the Challenge if the PCs decide to go about things in a particularly effective (or ineffective) way. This mostly happens if there is a Static Goal, as a Dynamic Goal will definitely have its outcome at one point, and the PCs effectiveness or ineffectivess will just alter that outcome. 

The amount of time a Stage takes is fluid. When traversing a dangerous hallway, each Stage may only represent a number of seconds. When preparing a grand magic ritual, each Stage might represent hours or days worth of time. Stages need not be fully consecutive: you or the players can narrate a montage in between Stages where the PCs progress through a different (or the same) Environment but no Obstacles have to be overcome or rolls are made.

# Running the Challenge
Once the GM has set up the framework of their Skill Challenge - either in preparation or on the fly - they're ready to run the Challenge. In the Challenge the PCs move through the different Stages, Environments and Obstacles in order to reach their Goal.

---

## Moving through Stages
When the PCs enter a Stage of a Challenge, describe the Environment and Obstacles present in the Stage. Be sure to add detail to the Environment to give the players inspiration on how they can overcome the Obstacles. Make it clear if there is a limit to how many PCs can take an action to overcome an Obstacle (a single locked door doesn't invite for many different participants). If it doesn't seem like everyone can contribute to clearing the Obstacles in a Stage, consider adding more Obstacles. You can also start adding more Obstacles in as the Stage progresses if it works in the narrative.

### Declaring and Resolving Tasks
The action a PC takes to clear an Obstacle is referred to as a Task. Each PC gets to perform a Task to try and overcome the Obstacles in the Stage. Let their imagination run wild: the goal is not for the players to find the exact solution to your Obstacles, but to have their PCs shine in action. If they propose a certain out-there Task to achieve a certain out-there result, allow it and frame the rest of the Stage to accomodate it! If they suggest a feature might be present in the Environment to base a cool Task off, be lenient ('sure, there can be a chandelier on the ceiling to swing from!'). If they want to incorporate a flashback of preparation they might have done earlier, allow that with leniency as well. The PCs can declare their Tasks in whatever order they want. If it makes sense narratively: when one player declares an action that would create new opportunities for other Tasks, they can build on that. If the players can't decide or don't want to decide on an order themselves, let them roll Initiative to decide the order.

When a Task is declared, the GM and player decide on what kind of check is required to complete the Task. Most Tasks will be skill checks. If the Task selected involves taking out opposition by fighting, use an attack roll (condensating combat into a single roll). If a PC with magical capabilities wants to use their magic but not a specific spell (which may be a limited Resource), they can explain what magical effect they want to produce and roll a spellcasting check. Players can also decide to expend one of their limited Resources to fulfill a Task. In this case a roll is not required, they get an automatic success. It's good to inform the players, especially in the case of spells, that the effect of the spells will sometimes not be handled exactly to the letter. Some spells are capable of instantly solving a Challenge if used as written. To avoid this, have a spell grant an effect that's in line with the purpose of the spell, but not verbatim to the spell's text. This may require some negotiation with the player, and if they decide the adapted effect is not worth it, let them retract their choice and go in a different area.

Sometimes not all players can (or have to) think of a separate Task for their PC. In that case they can choose to help another PC instead. If they explain how they help out, the other PC gets a +2 to their roll. Any negative consequences of a failed roll then apply to both PCs. Generally only one PC can help one other, but in some cases - if it makes sense in the narrative - two or more PCs might provide help to a single ally. If you put the players in a situation where only one PC can attempt a Task and that the others can only help, communicate that clearly beforehand.

Once a player has declared their Task and the type of roll has been decided, the player rolls their dice. After the dice are rolled, the GM compares the results to the DC for the Tasks and narrates the outcome. If wanted, the players can also add to the narrative of the outcome. This process continues until every PC has rolled for a Task or has aided on a Task (so everyone has had a chance to contribute).

The DC for Tasks in the Challenge are based on the environmental tier (13th Age specific, for D&D use a default DC of 9+PB). DCs can be shifted up or down at the GM's discretion. Always communicate the difficulty of a proposed Task to the player before they roll. A failed Tasks doesn't mean no progress is made, but that progress is made at a cost. With a Static Goal the cost is to the PC themselves (damage, resource loss, ongoing penalties), and with a Dynamic Goal the cost can be towards the final outcome. 

##### Task Difficulty 
| Task Difficulty       | Adventurer Tier | Champion Tier | Epic Tier |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Easy**              | DC 10           | DC 15         | DC 20     |
| **Normal** (default)  | DC 15           | DC 20         | DC 25     |
| **Hard**              | DC 20           | DC 25         | DC 30     |
| **Nearly impossible** | DC 25           | DC 30         | DC 35     |

If a PC uses a limited Resource to fulfill their Task, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached.

### Stage Resolution
After every Task has been rolled and the narrative has proceeded, the PCs move on to the next Stage. Always apply failing forward here: the Stage ends after everyone has performed their Task, even if all rolls were a failure. The narrative in which they move on to the next stage might just not look so good, and they'll likely incur some costs/complications. In the case of a Challenge with a Dynamic Goal, a string of failures might negatively affect the final outcome of the Challenge.

### The Next Stage
In the next stage, a new Environment and/or Obstacle is presented to the PCs. Always try to build the next Stage on the actions and outcomes of the previous Stage. After the Stage is set, everyone thinks of their Tasks as before. However: their previous attempts may have wearied them out! If **a player wants to perform a Task that uses an exact same roll they've already employed earlier in the Challenge**, the difficulty of the Task moves up one level (DC+5). This nudges players to think outside of the box, rather than only employ their apex skills or abilties. Note that this penalty applies at the individual level: if PC1 used Ability X in Stage 1, PC2 can use Ability X in Stage 2 without any penalties.

---

## Reaching the Goal
When the final Stage of the Challenge has concluded, the PCs reach their Goal.

### Static Goals
In the case of a Static Goal, they achieve just that. The outcome of the different Stages determine whether they suffer any negative consequences while doing so. Any successful roll means the PC accomplished their Task in a Stage without any real difficulty. Any failed roll means the PC accomplished their Task with difficulty or at a cost, such as HP loss, Recovery loss, loss of an item or an ongoing penalty to a specific ability score, attacks or defenses until a next full rest.

### Dynamic Goals
In the case of a Dynamic Goal, the outcome of each Stage influences the final Goal that the players achieve. As a rule of thumb: if **at least half of the Stages are successful**, there is a positive effect on the Goal. The final Goal that is achieved is a culmination of the successes and failures of each Stage. The default Goal (good, neutral or bad) is up to the GM.

##### What determines if a Stage is successful?
To have a Stage be resolved successfully, the PCs have to obtain a score of **more than half** the amount of Tasks performed\. So if a party of 5 PCs decides on performing 4 Tasks (with 1 PC helping another), at least 3 points must be earned for a successful outcome of the Stage. Assign points to the score as follows:

| Outcome of the Task Roll | Points awarded                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DC to DC+4*               | 1 point                                                                            |
| DC+5 or higher           | 2 points                                                                           |
| DC-1 to DC-5             | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a minor cost/complication to the PC (player's choice)                    |
| Lower than DC-5          | 0 points, *or* 1 point with a major cost/complication to the PC (player's choice) |

* As before: if a limited Resource is used, don't roll but assume the DC has been exactly reached (so award 1 point)

Note that, unlike with a Static Goal, a failed roll does not automatically mean a cost or complication. As a failed roll already can negatively contribute to the Dynamic Goal, punishing a PC for a failed roll as well is unfair. However, if needed to complete a Stage successfully, a player with a failed roll can always choose to take a cost/complication in order to add a point to the score. This might pose interesting dilemmas for the player who first declares their Task if they roll a failure, as they won't know how the rest will perform!

## Ending the Challenge
After all the Stages of the Challenge have been completed, present the Goal that they have accomplished. With a Static Goal this is just the only outcome. With a Dynamic Goal, tally up the successful and failed Stages to determine the final outcome.
