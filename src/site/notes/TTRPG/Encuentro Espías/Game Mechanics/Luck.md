Being a successful Spy doesn’t come without relying on a healthy dose of luck. To represent this, each Spy has a **Luck** score. Your Luck score starts at 1. You can increase your Luck by voluntarily taking -1d on a roll you’re about to make, or by accepting that the GM can impose a -1d penalty on any of your future rolls. If you roleplay your Spy incredibly well, or if you do something extremely amusing, the GM may also grant you an increase to your Luck at their discretion. Refer to the [[TTRPG/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#Luck Moves\|Basic Moves that deal with Luck]] for the exact parameters.

When you want to use your Luck, you roll a dice pool equal to your Luck score. Like any other roll, the highest number rolled determines the outcome. Beware though: if your highest number rolled is a 1, something bad happens! After you’ve made a Luck roll, your Luck score resets to 0.
