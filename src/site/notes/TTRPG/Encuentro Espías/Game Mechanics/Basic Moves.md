**Basic Moves** are Moves that all Spies can trigger. They cover most of the actions that you could take as a Spy. Any action that doesn't seem to fall clearly under one of the Moves will be handled as the **Act Under Pressure** Move. Below are all the Basic Moves collected. If you want more detailed explanations and examples of play, look [[TTRPG/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Detailed Moves and Examples of Play\|here]].
