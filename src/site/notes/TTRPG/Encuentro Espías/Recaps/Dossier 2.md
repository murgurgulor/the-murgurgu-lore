# Dossier #2
## The Pulling of Threads

**Keiko** ‘gee-wilikered’ their way in to being The Junior Minister’s shadow for the night. Shadowing him backstage, Keiko saw **The Junior Minister** make a deal with **The Roadie**. During the night, they also got photos of **The Junior Minister** handing off documents to **The Media Moghul** and managed to swap out The Minister’s real cue cards for an acceptance speech with fake ones. Unfortunately, their photocamera broke down in the process.

**Pam** charmed a talented maracas player to be allowed to go backstage. There she learnt The Junior Minister had given The Roadie a **pamphlet on social democracy**, which she apparently found very convincing. But Pam had to head off when the deafening maracas were ruining the mambo.

At the behest of The Media Moghul, **Simone** gave an inspiring speech. She shamed those war mongering allies of **The General**, and implied The Junior Minister was the better choice. The soldiers were chagrined. In exchange, The Media Moghul gave Simone **The Bookie Slips** that The Junior Minister had collected, along with the combination of **The Safe** in **The President’s Office** (13 10 48). She explained that **The Party Accounts** in The Safe, combined with The Bookie Slips, will show **The General** has been making up gambling losses using party funds.

**Dmitri** intimidated his way in the kitchen in an attempt to follow **The Wife**. He agressively forced his way by the head chef, leaving a mass of broken plates in his wake, and loudly proclaimed his needs for lemons and limes. He noticed the large array of food being made, regular fridges, a walk-in fridge, and waiters heading in and out for breaks. But where did The Wife go??

**The President** was wondering the same thing. He entered The Ballroom, avoiding attention while he sought after her.

**Jordy** had been on a private odyssey up until that point. He entered the **Secret Passageway** in the Garden. The first passage he took brought him to some kind of laundry cupboard. Bored with the linens, he retreated back the way he had come. Unfortunately for him, **The General** and **The Captain** were coming back the other way! He distracted them with pocket change, and dashed up the other arm of the passageway. Stepping out of grandfather clock, he found himself in **The President’s empty office**. One room was a working office with a war table and a **Safe** with a combination. The other room was a library, with a fireplace and large brass statue. Bored with the office, Jordy poured himself a drink and charmed his way out the locked door with his pants on his ankles, claiming to be a private guest of the President. He even got a copy of the Office key.

**Dmitri** trailed the staff on break, and chatted to them. He learnt The President has **explosive diarrhea** if he eats whipped cream. On his way out, he ran into Jordy, who handed him The President’s own tequila glass.

Now, finally, all our spies joined one anoher in The Ballroom. The President and The Wife made their grand entrance. **Pam** drugged **The Junior Minister’s** drink with amphetamines to give him confidence, but **Keiko** ended up drinking most of it! **Dmitri** and **Pam** shared a sultry dance, where he wooed her with intel about **The President’s diarrhea** but got nothing in return. Suspecting Pam might be on her side, **Simone** gave **Pam** half of **The Bookie Slips** for safe keeping. **Jordy** charmed **The Wife**, and she asked him to find her later. Jordy then asked one of the servers for ‘**El Ansia**’, and was asked to follow him outside. **Keiko** gave The President **The Junior Minister’s real cue cards**, with their treacherous plans to democratize the nation. **Keiko** disguised themself as a girl afterwards to avoid any suspicion.

Not knowing of this betrayel, **The Junior Minister** brought out **The Cake** to toast his uncle. But **The Roadie** went to take the first slice! This let The Junior Minister take her out in a staged fight to make him look tough. But, little did he know, soldiers were already on their way to quietly arrest him. **Pam** put pressure on an officer at the party, using **The Bookie Slips** and **Catholic guilt** to get him to intervene to help The Junior Minister. The officer took over from the other soldiers in ‘arresting’ The Junior Minister.

Outside, **Jordy** tried to score some ‘**El Ansia**’ from the server. Only then did he realize El Ansia was not what he expected it to be, but instead some kind of **rebel code phrase**. Bribing the server, Jordy learnt that whoever was named successor would not leave this Island alive. The server warned him ‘**the band must play on all night**’. All this was witnessed, unbeknownst to anyone, by **Keiko** and their trusty recording device.

Back at the party, **The Wife** was on her way to sing her patriotic song, not realizing the **Lyric Sheet** had been tampered with earlier. **Dmtri** lucked out and found one of his own as a waiter near the cake. He readied a vial of **LSD** to be poured over a specific slice of the cake. **Pam** distracted **The Wife** by spilling her drink on her. The empty vial was planted in The Wife’s purse. And the LSD? Ingested in its entirety by **The President**...
