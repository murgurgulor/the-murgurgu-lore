# Mission Statement
We have received information that the President will soon step down and announce his successor at a lavish party. According to our sources, he plans on appointing the General for the position. This is detrimental to our nation’s interest!

Your mission is to go undercover and infiltrate the party. There, you must prevent the General from being chosen as successor and to extend your full effort into making ***[REDACTED]*** the most eligible successor instead! Keep in mind that influencing the situation too directly is very dangerous and must be avoided. We advise you to dig up any dirt you can on the General and expose it, and make sure that any compromising information on ***[REDACTED]*** remains well hidden.

And for God’s sake, DON’T DRAW SUSPICION ON YOURSELF!
