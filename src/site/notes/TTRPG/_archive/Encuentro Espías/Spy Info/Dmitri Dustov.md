# Comrade Dmitri Dustov
### Age 52, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

Dmitri Dustov is of the old guard. At the end of the Russian Revolution he made his way quickly in the agencies that would eventually form the KGB, not eschewing violence or threats to get ahead of others. Due to his long years of service, he has a breadth of experience to draw from but he’s probably been undercover for longer in his life than he has been himself. 

##### Cover Story
His cover on The Island is as the owner of its biggest mambo club.
