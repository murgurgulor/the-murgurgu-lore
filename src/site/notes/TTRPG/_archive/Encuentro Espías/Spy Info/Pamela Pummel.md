# Special Agent Pamela Pummel
### Age 41, United States of America

Pam is an up and coming rookie in the CIA. What she lacks in experience, she makes up for in a can-do attitude, guile, wiles, and a healthy dose of moxy. 

##### Cover Story
Her cover on The Island is as the rather dull housewife of the American Ambassador, who is presently back in Washington for a meeting.

##### Specialties
Pam prefers to tackle problems with **Guile**, **Flair** and **Wit**. She’s not very good at doing things with **Focus**.

If you play Pamela Pummel, you will have access to these **Specialty Moves**:
