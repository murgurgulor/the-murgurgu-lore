# Intelligence Officer Jordy Jameson
### Age 29, Great Britain

Jordy Jameson is your typical young and strapping spy, and he probably inspired Ian Fleming’s James Bond to some degree. His charms and his skills have quickly advanced his career in MI6. With a thick head of blonde hair and a smile as bright as the sun, he’ll jump headlong into any mission with gusto and passion. 

##### Cover Story
His cover on The Island is as a feckless millionaire playboy restocking his yacht and having a few laughs.
