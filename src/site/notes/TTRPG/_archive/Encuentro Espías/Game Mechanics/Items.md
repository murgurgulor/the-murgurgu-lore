Each Spy can bring a few items along with them to the party. Seeing as they're limited by their cover in how much they can feasible carry on them, they'll have to be prudent with what they choose to bring!

Each Spy has 3 item slots. Most items take up 1 slot, but some of them take up 2 slots. Items primarily grant Narrative Permission to actions, but items that take up 2 slots can convey a mechanical bonus as well. Items can be picked more than once, as long as it fits in the inventory.
