The following is more in-depth information about the various Basic Moves, including how they would be used in play. The Luck Moves are not featured here.

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eeaup\|Act Under Pressure]]
Act Under Pressure is the basic catch-all Move that covers any activity that a Spy could attempt, but isn’t covered by any other Move. It requires that there is at least one way in which things could go wrong or get complicated if the activity doesn’t get done successfully or within a timely manner.

##### Example
Neil is disguised as a waiter and is sneaking around the Tabula Tropicana Restaurant in search of evidence of illicit activities by the Armenian government. He wants to gain access to files that are kept in an office, but the door is locked. Neil wants to get through the door: not something that is really covered by any other Move, and there is certainly a danger involved of getting caught in the action or busting the door in such a way that it’s noticeably someone has been snooping around. The GM tells Neil that opening the door would be an Act Under Pressure move, how does he want to go about it? 

Neil considers his options: he could try to bust the door down with Force, or maybe try to pick the lock with Focus. Any other Approach doesn’t really apply (except maybe looking for whoever has the key and lifting it off their body with Agility). Neil has a higher rating in Force but considers the potential complications of failing to open the door (loud noises, an obviously broken door) and decides he’ll try his hand on the sneakier lockpicking. Neil has a rating of 1 in Focus so he rolls 1d6 and rolls a 4: it Goes Reasonably Well.  

The GM considers the possible complications and offers Neil an ugly choice: the lock is almost opened, but there is a resistance at the end. Neil can choose to abandon his endeavors and find a different way through the door, or he can push through, open the door, but break his tools in the process - meaning he can’t pick any locks again until he manages to find a new set. Neil decides to go for it and chooses to open the door but break his tools. The door swings open as Neil’s tool snaps, but he’s inside!

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eeoverpower\|Overpower]]
Sometimes, subterfuge only gets you so far and you’ll have to take someone out physically in order to advance your plans. This activity is condensed in the Overpower Move. When you attempt this Move, the goal is to physically incapacitate someone. When it goes reasonably well or very well, you succeed in doing just that, but there will always be side-effects to such a risky Move. You get to choose which complications you avoid:

- *No one will miss them for a while* means that any other affiliated NPC will not get suspicious of something being afoot.     
- *You don’t leave any evidence* means that someone who comes across the scene doesn’t notice that a fight took place. 
- *You don’t show physical signs of a struggle yourself* means that other people who see you won’t get suspicious of you or ask any difficult questions.  

##### Example
Neil finishes collecting evidence in the office and turns around, only to find a guard standing in the doorway. Neil reckons he can’t talk himself out of this one and will attempt to take the guard out. The Overpower Move is triggered and the GM asks how he wants to take the guard out. 

Neil considers his options: Force is the most obvious choice here, but his highest rating is in Guile so he wants to see if he could utilize that. He checks his inventory and sees he has some chloroform, perfect! He checks with the GM if he could use Guile to Overpower in this way, and the GM agrees after a short deliberation. Neil then describes how he saunters up to the guard with a distracting story, only to then quickly press a chloroformed cloth to the guards mouth. His Guile rating is 3, so he rolls 3d6. His highest roll is a 6: it Goes Very Well! 

The GM describes the guard slumping unconscious and asks Neil which two conditions he wants to apply. Neil considers that he doesn’t want to blow his cover yet so he doesn’t want to show physical signs of a struggle himself, and he also doesn’t want the guard to alert others so he shoves the guard in a cupboard and no one will miss him for a while. This means that there will be evidence of a fight in the office, but he’ll just have to deal with that.

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eenegman\|Negotiate/Manipulate]]
Negotiate/Manipulate is any way in which you try to get an NPC to do something for you. The Move specifies that the NPC must have a reason not to help you willingly already, and it also doesn’t trigger if the NPC would never consider helping you. It has to be someone who can and has to be persuaded, goaded, bribed or tricked into helping you. 

##### Example
Neil has discovered that a patron of the restaurant, Mme de la Frontroux, might have some compromising information on a government official that would go well with his stolen documents. Mme de la Frontroux is a cunning one, however, and does not easily give up her secrets. Negotiate/Manipulate triggers!

Neil considers how he wants to go about it. He could threaten her with Force, but that probably wouldn’t go well in a busy restaurant. Deceiving her with Guile or trying to explain why helping is in her own best interest with Wit is also an option, but Neil decides it would be useful to stay on the good side of Mme de la Frontroux in case he’ll need her as an ally in the future. Neil decides to use his charms to get what he wants and approaches the problem with Flair. Neil describes how he swaggers over and sits down next to Mme de la Frontroux, showering her with compliments and alluding mischievously as to perhaps comparing notes on certain Armenian matters. Neil’s Flair is at 2 so he rolls 2d6. The highest number rolled is a 5: it Goes Reasonably Well.

The GM portrays Mme de la Frontroux as being sufficiently charmed by this roguish knave, but she’s not a naive maiden. She leans over to Neil and whispers in his ears: “If you want access to my information, retrieve for me a file on my husband from the secret storage in the cellar.”

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eemcover\|Maintain Cover]]
You will have to try to Maintain Cover whenever someone catches you in a place you shouldn’t be or doing something you shouldn’t do. This usually is the result of a previously failed roll and your last chance to avoid suspicion. Failing this roll means you definitely have to cross off a Cover checkbox. When it Goes Reasonably Well it saves you for now, but if this person would catch you doing something weird again, you might not get another chance to Maintain Cover and immediately have to cross off a Cover checkbox.

##### Example
Resigned to this sidequest, Neil heads into the kitchen where he knows access to the basement is. Unfortunately the basement access is all the way in a corner and it would be weird for a waiter to linger around there. Neil describes how he wants to saunter up there without rousing suspicion and the GM prompts him to Act Under Pressure with Guile. Neil rolls but doesn’t get higher than a 2: it Goes Poorly! The GM describes how one of the chefs is walking up to him and angrily asks him what he’s doing there, and that there is a need for hands on tables 3 and 51. The GM asks what Neil wants to do. 

Neil briefly considers Overpowering the chef, but then decides on trying to talk his way out of suspicion instead, triggering Maintain Cover. Neil spins a tale of getting a vintage wine from the cellar for a table and rolls Guile: a 5. The chef stares at Neil for a moment but then gets back to his sauces, glancing over his shoulder once more with squinted eyes…

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eesurveil\|Surveil]]
Surveil is the Move you trigger when you want to gain more insight into your situation, in order to find out what’s happening, what to look out for, and what would be the best way to continue on. This requires concentration and a keen eye and ear, so the Move must be approached with Focus. When you trigger the Move, think of the question you want answered and ask it. If you later on act on one of the answers you’ve gotten, you take +1d on that roll.

##### Example
Neil has entered the basement, but observes a guard standing in front of the room that supposedly has the file on M. de la Frontroux. He decides he needs more insight on this situation - it wasn’t in his intel - and acts like he’s perusing the wine selection while keeping an eye out, triggering Surveil. He decides to ask what the best way to get in or out of the office is.

Neil gets ready to roll Guile - he’s pretending to be looking at wines after all -  but the GM stops him: sure, he’s putting up a ruse in order to Surveil, but the actual Surveilling is done by keeping a close eye on the coming and goings in the cellar: Focus. Neil grumbles as he rolls Focus, but he still manages to get a 6: it Goes Very Well. After the GM has answered his initial question, he can ask another follow-up question! 

The GM tells Neil that the best way in or out of the office is only through the guarded door: there is no other secret entrance. Disgruntled by this lack of options, Neil asks how he can best influence the guard? The GM then describes how Neil notices the guard is starting to read a book about baseball, perhaps that’s a hidden passion to exploit!

Neil decides to take his chances and walks up to the guard and starts talking about baseball, and he mentions coyly how he saw major league baseball player Antonio Ferreras out in the front of the restaurant and he tries to nudge the guard into going out to get an autograph. This is ruled as an Act Under Pressure (although a case for Negotiate/Manipulate could also be made) with Guile. Because Neil is acting on information learned from his Surveil he takes +1d on the roll for a total of 4d6: it easily Goes Very Well and the guard leaves his post.

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eereview\|Review Intel]]
When you want to recall your knowledge on a topic, you Review Intel. As this is purely a memory based Move, there is only one Approach to take: Wit. 

##### Example
Neil is in the basement room and has located a file cabinet, but unfortunately it’s locked with a numerical code. Neil tries to recall the restaurant owner’s date of birth, triggering Review Intel. Neil rolls Wit - his worst Approach with a rating of 0. He rolls a d6 twice and gets a 2 and a 6. Unfortunately he has to take the worst result and gets the 2: it Goes Poorly. Neil does not know the restaurant owner’s date of birth.

---

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eewellact\|Well Actually]]
Sometimes you need something in the moment that you could’ve conceivably prepared beforehand, but just didn’t mention. Once per game you can invoke this Move to reveal what happened in the past that will benefit you now! This could be an item you possess, information you know, a hidden escape route you have planned, or anything else.

##### Example
The GM wants to continue the narrative, but Neil gets up and says “WELL ACTUALLY, I made sure to have a notebook with all important numbers on me because I’m terrible at remembering them!” Sure enough, Neil has a notebook with all important numbers, including the restaurant owner’s date of birth. Neil enters the numbers in the lock and voila, the cabinet opens!

---

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eeaid\|Aid]]
If you have an ally around who is about to make a roll, and it makes sense for your help to be possible and useful, then you can choose to Aid your ally. Helping someone Overpower another is definitely possible and useful, but helping someone pick a lock is quite hard to do and probably not very useful. You have to declare your Aid before your ally makes a roll. If the outcome of the Aided roll has a complication attached to it (because it Goes Poorly or Reasonably Well), then the complication applies to you as well.

##### Example
As Neil made his way out of the basement without a bottle of wine, he roused the suspicion of the chef again. Neil had to cross off a Cover checkbox. However, a few minutes later Neil has traded files with Mme de la Frontroux and now has all the information he needs. All that’s left is to make a swift exit, but unfortunately the guards in the restaurant have caught on to some illicit activity going on in the restaurant. It doesn’t seem like they know who the spy is, though, so Neil has some time to make his escape still. 

Neil’s mother walks into the living room where Neil and the GM are playing and spontaneously takes up the character of Mme de la Frontroux. They decide that the best way for Neil to escape is to jump off the balcony to the lower floor and make his way to the staff exit. Neil’s mother describes how Mme de la Frontroux starts to make a scene to divert attention away from Neil, aiding him in his attempt to get out. Neil jumps nimbly off the balcony - Act Under Pressure with Agility - and takes +1d on his roll, bumping his 2d6 to 3d6. Unfortunately he only manages to get a 3: it Goes Poorly! Neil does jump off the balcony successfully but attracts a lot of attention doing so: the GM prompts both Neil and Mme de la Frontroux to cross off a Cover checkbox!

---

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eeinterfere\|Interfere]]
The opposite of Aid is Interfere. When you want to hinder another Spy and you’re in a position where you can effectively do so, you can attempt to thwart an action they’re about to undertake. You need to declare your interference before they make their roll. There are two possible outcomes: either the other Spy takes a penalty on their roll, or they don’t get to make their attempt at all. This last option means that the action never takes place, so there’s no failure or consequences for the target spy if this option is chosen! The level of success decides who chooses the outcome as, depending on the situation, either outcome might be more desirable for either party.

##### Example
Neil has landed with a grunt on the floor below. People start coming close, asking what is going on, and what the meaning of this is. Neil spots some car keys in the coat of a nearby guest and plans to stagger over to steal them with Agility, to then make his way to the parking lot and speed off in a car. He gets ready to roll Agility, but Mme de la Frontroux turns her coat on him and starts shouting from above claiming Neil is a spy! This prompts an Interfere from Neil’s mum, who rolls it with Flair. She gets a 5: this means that she is interfering, but Neil can choose how this affects him. Neil weighs his options: taking a -1d penalty would bump his Agility roll down to 1d6, not great chances of success and failing that roll would place him in even more danger. Neil decides to choose to break off his attempt alltogether. As this means he never attempted to steal car keys, there is also no consequence attached for him.

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eepittl\|Push it to the Limit]]
Sometimes you really need a win. You can declare you’re pushing it to the limit before you make a roll for a different Move to get an extra +1d. Going all out will draw attention to you one way or another, so you will always have to cross off a Cover checkbox when you use this Move.

##### Example
Neil decides there’s nothing to do but to go for it. He describes how he starts to run towards the staff exit, shoving aside anyone in his way and Pushing it to the Limit! Neil has to Act Under Pressure with Force and rolls with an extra die, meaning his action Goes Very Well but forcing him to cross off his last Cover checkbox. Neil is now Suspected!

---

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eewoti\|Walking on Thin Ice]]
When all Cover checkboxes are crossed off, you’re Suspected and this Move triggers. Any roll you make that’s related to illicit activities will receive a -1d penalty for as long as you are Suspected. Any odd move or failed roll might result in being taken away for further questioning, effectively removing you from the scene (but there may always be a way to get out of custody…)

##### Example
Neil has made it out of the restaurant and onto the streets. All he has to do now is make his way to the pick-up point a few streets down. Unfortunately he’s Suspected and there are guards on the streets! Neil tries to put on a look of innocence and whistles as he walks down the street. The GM asks Neil to Act Under Pressure with Guile. The penalty brings his roll from 3d6 down to 2d6, and Neil gets a 4: it Goes Reasonably Well. A guard stops Neil on the street and asks him who he is and what he’s doing here - Neil’s last chance to save himself!

---

### [[TTRPG/_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves#^eesth\|Shake the Heat]]
When you’re in a bad place, you can always try to shift attention away from yourself to regain some Cover. This is not without risk, however: a failed roll means you just draw more attention to yourself! If this only Goes Reasonably Well, it means that the status quo is maintained.

##### Example
Neil is racking his brain thinking about how to get out of this. He decides the best way to get people to leave you alone is to spout pseudo-anarchistic nonsense, so he starts a rant about how restaurant life is the biggest capitalist swine pit that exists and how everyone should revolt against sous chefs, sauciers and sommeliers. The GM asks Neil to Shake the Heat with Flair, taking a penalty on the roll again. Lucky for Neil, it Goes Very Well! The guard quickly retreats, Neil unchecks a Cover checkbox and now is no longer Suspected. He quickly makes his way to the pick-up location and heads to the safety of his home base!
