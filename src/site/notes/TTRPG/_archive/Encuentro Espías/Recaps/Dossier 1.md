# Dossier #1
## The Weaving of Threads

At the island mansion of **The President,** our spies assembled to try to influencing the naming of his successor. 

**Keiko**, the 'child genius on exchange', overheard **The General** and **The Captain** denigrating **The Junior Minister** for being a weak coward. **Keiko** trailed **The General** to **The President's Office**. There, he saw **The General** is equally dismissive of the other succession candidate: **The Wife**. Through Keiko's sneaking, he learned **The Wife** is thought to be disloyal to **The President**, while **The General** is accused of a gambling addiction.

**Jordy**, the British 'playboy', arrived with his date: the Headmistress of Keiko's host school, Agata. **Jordy** quickly left his date and started pounding shots with **Dmitri** the 'mambo club owner'. After a time, **Jordy** headed out to the pool in The Back Garden - deftly dodging Agata. Curiously, he saw **The Captain** walking away from the party. **Jordy** trailed him half-trousered. He noticed he was spotted by a guest on the balcony...

**Pam**, the 'wife of the US ambassador', and **Simone**, 'mother superior', both spent some time early in the evening chatting to **The Junior Minister.** He expressed support for progress and human rights. Pam was thwarted, briefly, by the advances of world famous bore George W. Jordanson. Luckily, **Dmitri** was there to sweep her off her feet for a sultry mambo across the floor. By the end, both suspected the other might not be what they seem. 

After, **Pam** and **Simone** followed **The Junior Minister** into The Kitchen. While they only stayed briefly, they had time to see an enormous cake depiciting a young and sexy President. **The Junior Minister** commissioned the cake, and was asking for it to be brought out later. He reminded everyone **The President** hates whipped cream.

Meanwhile **Keiko** was noticed by **The General** as he left the President's Office. Keiko tried to excuse himself but to no avail. The General ordered the guard to escort him out, while he followed awkwardly 3 steps behind. They crossed paths with the **Junior Minister**, who was on his way to the President's Office. The General budged the Junior Minister who awkwardly fell against a wall. 

After that sensuous dance, only **Dmitri**'s legendary member saved him from the clutches of George W. Jordanson. Keiko, the guard and The General cross paths with **Dmitri** trying to make his way in. His cover? It's the staff of his mambo club working in the kitchen tonight. Too bad it didn't fly with the guard. Even agressively huffing chloroform didn't intimidate them. Along with **Keiko**, **Dmitri** got tossed back out to The Ballroom. But not before they had another run in with **The Junior Minister**, emotional from whatever had happened in his uncle's office.

Meanwhile, at a shed deep in The Back Garden, **Jordy** followed **The Captain** to a small shed. There The Captain seemed to be waiting. Slightly after that, Jordy notices the man that spotted him from the balcony walk up and meet with The Captain. They talk a bit about 'his motivation for the scene'. Jordy thought of something he was craving, and used his wily charms to saunter up casually in his speedos and inquire about his craving with the two men. They eye him suspiciously as they mention that maybe some of the staff would be able to help him better with his cravings. Jordy makes his retreat. 

Having been kicked out of The Kitchen, **Simone** spotted **The Wife** heading to The Balcony, and followed. On The Balcony, **Simone** chatted to **The Wife** and **The Media Moghul**. With sleight of hand, **Simone** swiped some jewelry from **The Wife**. A wooden bracelet? **The Wife** brushed **Simone** off to head back to The Ballroom. **Simone** spoke to **The Media Moghul**, who offered to give Simone information in exchange for **Simone** embarrassing one of **The General's** men.

In The Ballroom, **The General** spent some time back stage, and talked to **The Band Leader**. A while later, it was **The Wife** who interrupted **The Band Leader** to hand over some sheet music. While **Pam** tried to get information from **The Wife**, **Keiko** used an a capella children's choir to distract the crowd. Enough, at least, for **Keiko** to mess with the sheet music. Now, **The Wife's** song of loyalty to **The President** is going to sound like a sarcastic joke.  Before **Pam** could get more from **The Wife**, The President's paramour rushed off to deal with a kitchen emergency. **Dmitri** is intrigued by the kitchen and cake and plans to follow after.

While **Jordy** is making his way back to the party, losing clothing along the way, he suddenly spots some movement! A hidden hatch opens in the shrubbery and **The General**'s head pops out! Jordy quickly starts intensely peeing against a tree to avoid suspicion as he discerns The General making his way towards the shed.

Finally getting a moment to herself, **Simone** examined the bracelet she stole from **The Wife**. It said '*Love always, The Media Moghul*'!
