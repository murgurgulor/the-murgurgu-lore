> ###### Spell Description 
> **Summon Efreeti**
> Costs 1d4 Sanity. Each Magic Point invested gives a 10% chance of success.
> Upon success, an Efreeti arrives after 20 minutes, streaking from the sky like a ball of fire. After summoning, the caster can immediately try to bind the Efreeti. Failure incurs the Efreeti's wrath.
> 
> **Bind Efreeti**
> Costs 1 Sanity. Make an Opposed POW check vs. Efreeti. On a win, bind the Efreeti to perform a task for you. After this it will return to its home dimension.
> Can give a Bonus Die on the POW roll by expending MP equal to 1/5 of the Efreeti's POW, though this cost is unknown.
> 
> An already bound Efreeti can be unbound in the same way, by making an opposed POW check versus the current binder.
