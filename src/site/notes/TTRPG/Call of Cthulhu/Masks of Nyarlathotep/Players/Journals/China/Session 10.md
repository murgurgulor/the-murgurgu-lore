### Dateline: Monday, April 13th, 1925
Matthias rushes to aid Zasu in first aiding Shark, but his golf-teaching techniques don't translate well to first aid. Shark regains consciousness, but the Deep Ones did a number on his back so his shoulder function is impaired for now. The Militia, having driven away the Deep One horde back into their pool, rejoice and celebrate. The group wearily observes the rotting arms still twitching and jerking.

Matthias and Dick check out Penhew's room. They find extensive blueprints for the missile inside the main chamber and other parts of machinery, but other than that it fits on the nose of the missile they can't work out its function. They also find a lead casket in a box but remembering Lawrence's experience on the Dark Mistress, they leave it alone. 

Dick goes through Penhew's correspondence and finds some interesting letters and notes, as well as Penhew's diary! He also spots an ornate sarcophagus in the corner but elects to leave it alone for now.

The two also peruse Penhew's book collection and find three interesting tomes:
- **The Resilient Mind**: an occult manuscript on how to strengthen the mind against magical influences
- **The Serpentfolk, Masters of History and Time**: a comprehensive history on the historical serpentfolk
- **Casting Yourself in the Afterworld - How to Stay Safe and Keep on Track**: an occult guide on effectively and safely contacting the spirits of the dead.

Meanwhile back in the main chamber, Lawrence, Shark and Zasu stare in horror at the rotten arms. They are dragging themselves across the cavern floor on decaying finger and broken nails, grabbing on to one another and slowly forming a terrible amalgamous mass of arms. Shark ineffectively fires his gun into the mass and Lawrence throws a stick of dynamite in that blows a bunch of them to smithereens, but with almost renewed vigor the remaining arms gather and collect themselves. Towering up to 3 meters rises a monstrous abomination of grasping and clawing arms, and it's starting to pull itself forward! A few unlucky soldiers get grabbed by the hands and their flesh gets torn apart. One unlucky fellow gets pulled in the mass of arms, screaming for his life. When the muffled screaming stops, two new arms sprout from the thing.

### The Arm Horror

The group quickly decides to kill it with fire. Shark sprint around and finds some jerrycans of oil. Dodging away from the grasping appendages he manages to surround the thing with oil. Lawrence throws a torch in and the mass of arms catches fire! As some of the arms start to burn and wither away, it suddenly jerks towards Zasu with unexpected speed. Several arms grab on to her and start to pull her into the mass! Lawrence and Shark quickly jump in and help her free herself from its clutches. 

Dick and Matthias enter to see what all that ruckus is about, but confronted with the scene of a burning mass of rotting arms and Zasu almost being dragged in, Matthias flees the scene and Dick's mind finally snaps. The group decide to try and lure it into the pit of magma. Dick jumps in valiantly to distract it but in turn he now gets grabbed! Once again Lawrence and Shark help out so Dick can pull himself free. They manage to lead the burning - and quickly slinking - mass of arms to the rope bridges which start to collapse as the fire burns away the ropes. The arms try to grab on to something but find nothing but air. The arm horror plunges in the magma, which in turn start to violently bubble and churn.

As Matthias is emerging from under Penhew's bed, Dick's mind turns inward. He now finally comprehends the truth. K'thuga is the only answer, the only safety. The fire is warm and the fire cleanses and the fire protects. As Dick's broken mind reaches strongly for K'thuga, a voice in his head whispers 'I will keep you safe in my warm embrace.'

Getting back to business, Lawrence checks out the sarcophagus in Penhew's room. When opened, it shows nothing but a blackness. He throws in a torch that promptly disappears. Zasu identifies this as a Gate Box: a Box that connects to another Box somewhere in this dimension to allow for quick transportation. Matthias tries to poke only his head in but he immediately gets wholly sucked through. The others try to grab on to each other but comically get sucked in as well. They momentarily float through an empty void with millions of burning eyes staring at them, before being deposited on a dusty stone floor. They head up a stairs and find themselves in the Misr House in England! It looks to have been abandoned for several months now. They take a quick breather and find a secret sacrificial chamber, but ultimately decide they have to head back through the Gate Box to deal with the missile and not miss the boat off the island.

Back in the volcano, the group finds strange alien welding devices. They decide to use these to burn through the struts on the missile. After securing the lemon juicer part in Penhew's workshop, they collapse the struts and the missile collapses in the magma. Consequentially the magma start to violently splutter and the volcano starts to shake and tremble. As the group makes their way out, they also hear a gurgling conshell horn: the Deep Ones have returned! On their harrowing run down the mountains and through the forest, Dick, Shark and Zasu stumble and take a few beatings. As they reach the beach, where the boats are being readied by the remaining soldiers and Jack Brady, a horde of villages brandishing tridents and sickles are also running towards them. They quickly jump on board and set off at full speed. When they're about an hour out of Grey Dragon Island on the open seas, they see a glorious eruption on the horizon.

# Dateline: Tuesday, April 14th, 1925
Traveling through the night, the boats finally make their way back to good ol' Shanghai. They have survived Grey Dragon Island and permanently dealt with the Pale Viper and his strange, curious missile.
