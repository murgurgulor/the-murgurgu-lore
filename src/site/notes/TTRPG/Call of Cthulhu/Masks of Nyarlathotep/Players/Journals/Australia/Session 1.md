# Boat Scene
The group has purchased first class tickets on a passenger ship from Hong Kong to Darwin. They mingle with the rich and the influential that share their berth. Shark spends most of his time in the ship's on-board casino playing Blackjack, while Matthias wows the nobleborn with his shuffleboard skills. Zasu and Dick spend most of their time out on the deck reading occult books. Zasu does this while getting a tan and Dick does this while periodically staring directly into the sun. Lawrence meanwhile is pacing across all decks carrying all the worries and burdens of the party concerning the cult of Nyarlathotep, the Serpentfolk, and the elusive Observer.

Midway their journey, a castaway is spotted. A gaunt man who identifies himself as Jozias Tuigstra, a Dutch sailor from a wrecked merchant vessle, is hauled aboard. Strangely enough he's cradling a dirty white ball with a face painted on it, whom Jozias refers to as Willem.

The day after, screams wake up the passengers. One of the sailors has found a gruesome scene on the tanning deck. Passenger Quinten Quatswurster, an Austrian scholar, has been savagely massacred. Deep red stains are smeared out over the deck and different body parts of the man are found in different places. It seems to be a crude hack-and-slash job. The group offers their investigative services to the captain and set out looking for clues. They soon find footprints in the blood that belong to large workboots. They head to the crews' quarters and investigate the different shoes present at the bunks. They find a match in the boots of mechanic John Wilkins. They track him down in the engine room and take him down for interrogation.

John Wilkins explains that he doesn't really remember what he did last night. He describes having a dream of floating in darkness, when suddenly a small prick of light appeared that told him to 'do the work, do the job, the work needs to be done'. After that all he remembers is vague impressions of dragging someone out of a bunk and hacking away with an axe. When he woke up in the morning he found his boots covered in blood and cleaned them in a panic. John Wilkins is reduced to a sobbing heap when he realizes what he has done, and allows himself to be put in the brig.

The group suspects foul deeds afoot and go looking for Jozias and Willem. Willem is nowhere to be seen but they find Jozias sitting on the deck enjoying the trip. They confront Jozias with the events and Jozias explains that he and his crew found Willem floating on the ocean one day. They hauled the ball aboard, and soon after people started hearing voices. Voices that told them to do destructive things. One after another they started harming, mutilating and murdering each other, until only Jozias was left standing. Then, under Willem's thrall, he set the ship ablaze. The group asks why he just wouldn't get rid of Willem, but Jozias explains that he simply can't. Willem wouldn't let him.

Reaching back to their occult knowledge, the group comes to the revelation that Willem must be a Raujasza - a being from a different dimension that is so wholly unlike our dimension, that the creature can't exist in any form here. It needs to bond itself to an object of this world to exist here, and it's nature causes those near it to fall into murderous delights. They set out to find Willem - who can move on his own accord - until they hear a sudden scream from the kitchens. One of the kitchen staff's decapitated head is served on a platter. One of the other staff explains that the head chef did the deed. 

The group finds the head chef on the uppermost deck, cradling Willem. The head chef is just about to jump to his death below, but Dick lunges forward and grabs him by the ankle. Willem spins around on the deck and peers into the minds of every investigator in order to get them to assault each other, confronting them with their deepest, darkest fear.
- Shark most fears losing his brother Dick, but he pushes away this fear by recalling how Dick can take good care of himself with his Eternal Torch.
- Matthias most fears being just a below average academic, but he pushes away this fear by recalling his popularity among the students of Arkham's Miskatonic University.
- Zasu most fears that secretly, nothing really matters no matter what you do, but she pushes away this fear through mental exercise, reaching into a core memory, and starts tapdancing.
- Lawrence most fears that his peers at home will tell him that writing and solving mysteries is not a real job and that he needs to just go work in the mines, but he pushes away this fear by reminding himself that he doesn't ever have to go back there.
- Dick most fears that for all his power, he's not any different than the people they're fighting and it's just people hurting each other over nothing, just like WW1. He pushes away this fear by realizing that that is exactly what Willem is doing to him, so if he fights the ball he'll fight his fears!

Broken free of Willem's compulsion, Matthias stabs the Sword of Akmallah into Willem to deflate him and Dick sets the Eternal Flame of K'tuga on the ball. It burns to a fine ash that gets picked up in the wind. As Willem disperses, the faintest whisper is heard in their heads.

"I wonder where I'll fly to now..."

The group presents their victory to the captain, putting both the head chef and Jozias - who is joyfully crying to be freed of Willem's influence - in the brig as well. They then continue their journey in peace and quiet.

The group arrives in Darwin. It is incredibly humid, warm and it smells pretty bad.
