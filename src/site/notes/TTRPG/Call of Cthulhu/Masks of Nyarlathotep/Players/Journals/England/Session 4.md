### Dateline: Tuesday, February 3rd, 1925
After the meeting with Gavigan, the group evaluates their strategy so far. They reflect on their initial lie about planning an expedition to gain credibility within the Penhew Foundation, and their current possession of many forms and documents pertaining to this fake expedition. The group decides there’s nothing to do about it now, and they proceed to look ahead. They contact boat friend Walter Keyes and arrange a black taxicab for them to use. It’ll be ready the next day.

There are several avenues of inquiry that the group are going to visit this afternoon. Dick and Shark decide to hit up Inspector Barrington of the Egyptian Murders, to see what he knows and what parallels can be drawn to the Forehead-Carving Murders in New York. Matthias and Lawrence decide to hit up the library and newspaper archives to learn more about Edward Gavigan and the mystical Misr House. Zasu is going to meet up with her boat friend, Madam Elvira, to find answers in the spiritual realm.

##### Dick, Shark and Barrington
Dick and Shark make their way to New Scotland Yard and ask for Barrington at the desk. Shark makes a flirtatious comment. After some time on uncomfortable chairs, they’re greeted by a thin and stoic man who introduces himself as James Barrington. He gives a firm yet dry hand. They go to his office to talk about the Egyptian Murders. Barrington seems a very neat and immaculate man, with nothing to decorate his office except neat stacks of papers and simple furnishings. Barrington takes extensive notes on their conversation. Dick presents his case file of the Forehead-Carving Murders and Barrington reads it thoroughly. Barrington comments that there are definitely similarities between the cases, mostly multiple people being murdered in the same way, but doesn’t see anything beyond that. When Dick points out that Jackson Elias was one of the victims, Barrington’s interest is piqued. He tells Dick and Shark that Jackson Elias visited him last december to talk about the Egyptian Murders. Barrington divulges the following information:

- Elias talked with him last december and said that the murders were ritual killings performed by an organization known as the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh: an Egyptian death cult
- Following the tip, Barrington got in touch with the Penhew Foundation to see if they could corroborate this information. He met with Edward Gavigan who confirmed there was once such a society in ancient times, but they died out hundreds of years ago. Gavigan mentioned that Jackson had been in contact with him earlier as well, and Gavigan said Jackson was a sensation-seeking profiteer and not a reliable source of information.
- Barrington also asked Gavigan about a witness who came upon one of the dying victims, and said the victim cried out ‘Hotep!’ as he died. Gavigan informed Barrington that it’s and ancient Egyptian word meaning ‘rest’ or ‘peace’
- In investigating the Egyptian angle, Barrington came upon the Blue Pyramid Club in Soho, a club frequently visited by both residential and visiting Egyptian businessmen. A large number of the victims had visited the club. Barrington had the place under surveillance for a while, but nothing was learned from it. He did notice many employees from the Penhew Foundation were on the members list, but that didn’t surprise him given their interest in Egyptian things. Gavigan was not on the members list.
- He interviewed a large number of Egyptians, most of which had little to offer. The only one that stood out to him was a spice dealer by the name of Zahra Shafik. Shafik mentioned she recognized the name of the Brotherhood from stories her grandma told her in Egypt when she was young (’behave, or the Brotherhood will come and take you!’). Desperate for any leads, Barrington had her tailed for a few days, which confirmed she frequented the Blue Pyramid Club, but little else was learned.

Inspector Barrington gave off an air of desperation, as he finds it a professional failure of his that he’s been on this case for a year with 4 new murders but no new leads. When talking about his predecessor, Gregory Munden, Barrington is quite open about his suspicion that Munden probably got too close to the truth and got assassinated. Unfortunately none of Munden’s notes give any direction.

Finally, Barrington warns Dick and Shark to be careful themselves: forensic reports suggest that each victim was assaulted with a blunt weapon before being stabbed through the heart, and the attacks seemed to have been carried out by people of different heights, suggesting the murders are a group activity.

Dick and Shark thank Inspector Barrington for his time, and they’ll keep in touch if they learn anything useful. Barrington has warmed up to the boys and extends an offer to help them if they need it. Dick seizes the opportunity to ask about expediting his firearms license request. Barrington will see what he can do.

##### Matthias and Lawrence
Matthias and Lawrence buddy up and head to the London Library to browse index cards, peruse bookshelves and gather a trolley full of books on British Country Estates. They quickly learn that ‘Misr’ is the romanised spelling of the Arabic word for Egypt, so the Misr House is really just the Egypt House. Upon browsing through Greene’s Estates of England, a comprehensive reference document on country estates, they come upon an entry for the Misr House. They learn that the Misr House is located in Essex near the east coast. The estate is situated on a peninsule called ‘The Naze’, near the beachside town of Walton-on-the-Naze - a 4 hour drive from central London. They also learn the mansion was built in the 16th century during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, and went by the name of Long View until it was renamed in 1915. Unfortunately there’s no record of ownership present in this book, but this would probably be located in the archives of the Chelmsford Council in Essex.

After learning a great deal about British estates, they turn their attention to the newspaper archives to learn more about Edward Gavigan from the social columns. Their search ends up with disappointingly little information. They read about Edward Gavigan’s academic prowess on the field of Egyptology and his close connection with Aubrey Penhew, who was featured in the society’s more prominently. They also learn that the Gavigan family comes from old money and is fabulously rich. Other than that, it doesn’t appear Gavigan attends London’s social scene all that much.

In the social columns, however, they do come upon the Misr House again! In newspapers dating back to 1915 and 1916, they read that the Misr House was owned by socialite and enthusiastic amateur Egyptologist Neville Lloyd-Price. Rumour had it that Lloyd-Price went bankrupt in 1915 and was forced to sell the property and land on which it stands. The colums then go to gossip about Lloyd-Price not being seen since 1916 and he has seemingly disappeared from London’s high society. Rumour has it that he turned to the bottle when he lost everything.

Drawing on this interesting information, Matthias and Lawrence consult public records for Neville Lloyd-Price and find his last known address. They also look up Gavigan’s address and find he lives in the esteemed Mayfair area.

##### Zasu and the Spirits
Zasu makes her way to Madam Elvira’s Palace of Wonders. She’s assaulted by smoke and incense when she enters, and Elvira ominously comments she’s been expecting Zasu. The mystical ladies sit at the table, join hands, and Elvira falls in a trance to contact the spirits. After some chanting and humming, Elvira looks up with pale pupils and speaks with a lofty voice: the spirits are ready to answer Zasu’s questions.

- Why are Egyptians being murdered?
	- The spirits groan and tell Zasu that the Egyptian are being murdered because the Grand Priest of the Brotherhood fears usurpation.
- Who is the Grand Priest of the Brotherhood?
	- The spirits surge through Elvira and tell Zasu that the Grand Priest of the Brotherhood is the White Jackal, the one named Edward Donald Gavigan!
- Who does Gavigan fear will usurp him?
	- Elvira moans, the spirits do not like this line of questioning! They draw away from Elvira, but Zasu quickly grabs her hands and chants the appropriate occult invocations to bind the spirits to Elvira once more. They then tell Zasu that Gavigan fears the Grand Priest of the Egyptian Brotherhood: The Demon-Man al-Shakti!
- Where can we find al-Shakti?
	- Once again the spirits try to draw away. This is dangerous information! Zasu chants with Elvira to powerfully bind the spirits once more. With great reluctance the spirits force their final words out of Elvira’s mouth: Gezira Mohammed.

Elvira shrieks as the spirits break the connection and draw away. Zasu thanks Elvira for her medium performance, and Elvira hopes that everything will now be clear for Zasu. Zasu comments how now she may only be in more danger, and Elvira responds that perhaps that is the way things are supposed to be…

##### Reconvention
The group regroups for dinner at the Savoy and shares their experiences. They draw the conclusion that Barrington doesn’t know anything they don’t already know, and will probably have to solve the case for him - just like in New York. Considering the full moon is 6 days away and they suspect something will happen at the Misr House at that time, the group decides it’s best to visit the Misr House sooner rather than later. They plan on heading there tomorrow morning after receiving a car from boat friend Walter Keyes.

After dinner, the group decides to hit up Neville Lloyd-Price. At his last known address in a poor part of the city, a miserly old lady opens up and screeches that she doesn’t know any Nevilles, and that she’s lived in the apartment for the past 7 years. They go up a few stairs to the landlord and learn that Neville Lloyd-Price just suddenly disappeared one day around 8 or 9 years ago. He stills owes the landlord several months’ rent. The landlord sold off all the furniture, and what he couldn’t sell he threw away, which included many journals with rambling writing about Egypt and pharaohs.

Bummed out by this dead end, the group decides to go back to the Blue Pyramid Club for some follow-up questions for Anya. Zasu sets up a meeting with her catch of the day before: Simon McGrinny. She takes off her engagement ring and gives it to Matthias for safe-keeping. Matthias is visibly distraught.

In the club, the group notices that Zahra Shafik is present once again, attended by several men. None of the Penhew Foundation employees are there. Zasu talks with Simon and tries to use some flirting to get him to talk more about Gavigan and hopefully reveal more about him. Unfortunately, she overshoots her mark and the initially stuttering and nervous Simon gets a boost of unearned hubris. Instead of talking about work, he just tries to chat up Zasu in an obsessive manner. Zasu spews an excuse about her old-fashioned grandmother and it being the 1920s, and leaves the club. Meanwhile, Lawrence mouths the Anya to meet him at the same time and same place.

At midnight in the alley, Lawrence and Anya meet up again. Anya is visibly anxious and nervous and asks him what he wants. Lawrence asks some questions about the Egyptian Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh and al-Shakti, but Anya says she doesn’t know anything about that. Her murdered boyfriend was never part of any cult, he was just a dockworker.

The rest of the group is hanging around near the alley as look-outs, and Zasu suddenly spots two men at the door to the Blue Pyramid Club. They appear to be smoking a cigarette, but keep throwing glances at the alley. She recognises them as being attendees of Zahra Shafik in the club. As Dick tries to distract the men by talking about his bowler hat, the group signals to each other and Lawrence about the danger, and Lawrence informs Anya. She runs off to the other exit of the alley and into the night. In order to confuse the men of what might have been going on in the alley, Zasu approaches Lawrence as he exits the alley and accuses him of running off with a belly dancer on their date. She gives him a firm slap on the face to add credence to the lie. Lawrence then mumbles more lies about it not being anything serious, perfectly enacting a lover’s quarrel. The men then throw away their cigarettes, mutter something about ‘this was useless’ and re-enter the club. The group sighs a breath of relief and head back to the Savoy for a good night’s rest.

### Dateline: Wednesday, February 4th, 1925
The group wakes up and enjoys breakfast. Walter Keyes shows up with a black taxicab and throws the keys to an overly excited Shark. Meanwhile, Lawrence reads the London Times and is struck with the following headline:

***Receptionist at the Royal Chester Hotel Brutally Beaten to Near-Death!***

The group fears that Gavigan might be after them…
