### Dateline: Wednesday, April 1st, 1925
The gang meets Jack Brady at midnight in a Firm Action warehouse. The place is old and dingy, but filled with target dummies, training mats and other combat training objects. Brady leads them to an office and sets out a drink. The group notices many different city plans and blueprints that would probably be used in the planning of terrorist attacks. The investigators and Brady talk about a plan to infiltrate Ho Fang's mansion and rescue Mei-ling. They decide it's worth checking out whether Ho Fang's mansion can be accessed through the sewers, and they obtain a sewer map from Firm Action's archives. They also decide they want to gain some more intel first on any cult activity in the city, as they fear that removing Ho Fang will just open the way for someone else to lead the cult. Through the powers of law they hope to shut down the cult legally and effectively. They also arm themselves with many illegal knives, shurikens, handguns, rifles and submachineguns from Firm Action's stores. 

Brady concurs with the group's plan to gain more intel, but warns them: if they're not going to help free Mei-ling the coming evening, he's going in solo.

The next morning, the group splits up to enact their plans. Shark loads everyone in their car (also requisitioned from Firm Action) and drops everyone off at their respective destinations.

##### Dick, Short Round and Inspector Chong
Dick takes Short Round to visit the Shanghai police station and talk to Inspector Chong. Dick introduces himself as a foreign investigator investigating the death of Jackson Elias, which can be traced back to Shanghai. He learns that there are strange murders happening in Shanghai for the past few years: bodies discovered without their arms, that seem to have been cut off by a sharp blade like a sickle. Sometimes these bodies pop up twice in a month. The arms have never been found. Unfortunately sickles are commonly used by the Shanghai underworld so it doesn't point to anyone in particular.

Dick tells Chong that he believes Ho Fang might be involved, but this does not land with Chong. Chong explains that Ho Fang is a well respected merchant whose business has done much good for Shanghai and its economy. Dick then whips out his notes on the occult and starts showing Chong. Chong believes Dick is a complete nutter and orders him out. Dick is now marked as a conspiracy theorist by the Shanghai police. Short Round ends up dragging Dick out of the police station as he screams that he can control magical fire with his mind.

##### Lawrence and the Monks
Lawrence goes to the temple that was destroyed by a magical fire. After talking to the head monk, he learns that the monks who died were experts on Chinese history between 650-1250. Afterwards he gets introduced to a young monk who was apprenticed to one of the deceased monks, and who witnessed the inferno. The young monk explains in a trembling voice that a large white man came to the temple to talk to the monks, until suddently a burning person flew from the sky and torched the temple, he followed the monks around and after they had burned to death, the man flew back up into the sky again! Before this happened, he overheard the man and the monks talking about the Seven Cryptical Texts of Hsan. An ancient esoteric text that supposedly holds information on the Dreamlands and ways to travel to them, as well as information on different planes of existence and how to find and/or close ways between them. He also heard them mention one Mu Hsien, a respected scholar on this time of history. 

##### Matthias, Zasu and the Flower Girls
While Matthias, Zasu and Shark drive to Lantern Street, Shark and Zasu whisper together conspiratorially, every now and then looking back at Matthias and giggling. Matthias pouts and fucks up the car with his shurikens. They get into an argument that ends with Shark punching Matthias in the nards.

Arriving in Lantern Street, Matthias and Zasu get out and Shark drives off to keep an eye on Jack Brady. Matthias and Zasu knock on the Flower Girl House that Mei-Ling originally worked at and are met with ill-named Quivering Jade again. She rolls her eyes at Matthias and calls the proprietor of the house: Auntie Gee. Auntie Gee is an old and stern looking lady who is reluctant to give them much information for free. They learn that one of the flower girls that witnessed the event, Magenta Joy, had to be interred in the psych ward of a Shanghai hospital. Matthias and Zasu visit her. Matthias tries to talk some sense into her to get more of a story, but to no avail. Matthias attempts to coax more info out of her by drawing a picture of the Sand Bat. This pushes Magenta Joy into madness and she starts clawing at her eyes. They decide to leave.

##### Shark and Jack Brady
Shark and Jack have a great time. Shark learns a chokehold called the Chung Huwei Choker. If used, this can incapacitate and stun a person momentarily!

##### All together now!
Everyone reconvenes. They question Jack about the Seven Cryptical Texts of Hsan and Mu Hsien, and he tells the group that he 'acquired' the ancient texts, and that Mu Hsien is an acquaintance of his who's currently looking over and translating the texts. It should take between one and two weeks for him to finish. 

The group looks at the sewer plans around Ho Fang's mansion. There seems to be sewer access to the outhouse in the compound, where a small person (which means everyone except Shark and Jack) would probably be able to squeeze through...
