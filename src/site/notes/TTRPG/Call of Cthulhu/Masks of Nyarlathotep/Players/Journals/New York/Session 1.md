### Dateline: Thursday, January 15th, 1925

After a relatively calm 9 months, the group gets a telegram from Jackson Elias on January 13th, 1925, stating he needs an investigative team to look into the Carlyle Expedition ([[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/New York Clues#[AM0] Telegram from Jackson Elias\|[AM0] Telegram from Jackson Elias]]) . On January 15th, Lawrence gets a phone call from a rushed and anxious Jackson, telling him to meet at the West Avenue Bar and Bistro at 19:30. The group gathers at the restaurant, but Elias is a no-show. At 20:00 Lawrence gets another phone call from a whispering Jackson, urging him to go to the Hotel Chelsea and ask manager Elliot Young to escort the group to his room, and to make sure they aren’t followed.

At the Hotel Chelsea the group meets Elliot ‘Ready’ Young and is escorted up to Room 410. After knocking provides no answer, Elliot opens the door with the master key and the group is greeted with a terrible sight: Jackson Elias is lying dead on the bed, covered in blood. Standing over him is an African-American man with a long curved blade, who appears to be carving something into Jackson’s forehead. Further in the room a second African-American man is seen rummaging through a desk, and a Caucasian man rummaging through some drawers. All three men are wearing a leather headband with a long strip of red cloth attached to it.

A fight ensues, in which Elliot punches one man, tackles another, but then collapses after he takes a grievous blade wound to the abdomen. Matthias puts his swordcane to good use after a cunning distraction from Zasu, but also suffers a major injury. Lawrence saves his companions, but not his soul, by putting bullets into the two African-American men. Meanwhile, Dick and Shark chase the Caucasian man through the streets, first on foot, later by taxi. The exciting chase ends when Dick successfully shoots the tires of the other man’s car, and they drag him off into an alley. Dick raids the car for documents the man had taken from Jackson’s room, and Shark silently ends the man’s life.

At the hotel, the investigators collect whatever meaningful documents they can find in Jackson’s room, hoping it will give them more information as to what is going on. They inspect the carving in his forehead ([[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/New York Clues#[AM8] Symbol on Jackson's Head\|[AM8] Symbol on Jackson's Head]]), which they identify as belonging to the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, an Africa based cult. They also see stylistic parallels to the tattoo on Augustus Larkin’s chest back in Peru. Police arrive and take stock of the scene. The group minus Dick and Shark is escorted to Precinct 7 where they are questioned by Lt. Martin Poole. The scene and initial interviews seem to line up with self-defense, so no arrest is made against the party. Lt. Poole leaves them with the information that in the past 2 years, 8 other murders have taken place where the victim has had similar carvings made in their foreheads. It all came to a halt in September 1924, when Capt. Robson of the 14th Precinct arrested Hilton Adams for the crimes, who is now on death row in Sing Sing Prison. It appears there either is a copycat, or the wrong man has been convicted…

The group reconvenes with Dick and Shark, and Matthias arranges private health care for himself and Elliot. The group then retires for the night, and finds the following morning that Jackson’s death has made the newspaper.
