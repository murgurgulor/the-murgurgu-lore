### Dateline: Thursday, April 2nd, 1925 
During the aftermath of their assault of Ho Fang's mansion and the ensuing manhunt by Inspector Chong for Crazy Dick Booker, the gang lies low in one of Firm Action's safehouses. They encounter a number of problems while holed up together.

Unfortunately after a mere day of seclusion, Matthias has already read every single written word available in the safehouse, including the crude graffitis on the walls. He starts to grow annoyed and angry, lashing out at everyone. Luckily, Lawrence has a clever plan! He persuades Zasu to write down their entire love story on paper, giving Matthias ample reading material as well as hopefully jogging his memory a bit!

Unfortunately the day after, Lawrence spots some lizards crawling around the safehouse. His earlier experiences with Ssassathassaa have made him keenly paranoid of lizard and snakes and he starts to get into a panic. Luckily, Dick has a clever plan! Knowing about certain fears that might be hard to understand himself, he tries to help Lawrence out by reading up on lizards and snakes, and together they set up a ritual to enshrine the safehouse against evil versions of those creatures! Was it a real ritual? Who knows. At least Lawrence feels safe again.

Unfortunately performing this ritual has tapped Dick into an obsession for the occult, and he proceeds to spend every waking hour pouring over the mystical tomes they have gathered and even trying to learn Chinese! He starts to sleep less and less, eventually not sleeping at all anymore, and his mental state is starting to fray quickly. Luckily, Shark has a clever plan! He knows Dick can get obsessive, and that a good way to get him out of it is to direct his attentions to something practical. He grabs a few padlocks and hairpins and challenges Dick to a lockpicking competition. This brings out Dick's competitive side and soon after he falls soundly asleep.

Unfortunately, all this time locked up is giving Shark the thing he dreads the most: time to think. He starts to think about their entire situation and all the evens of the past 3 months that have led them here, and he starts to slip into an existential crisis and suffers panic attacks. Luckily, Zasu has a clever plan! She uses her experience in the creative arts to persuade Shark to explore his own creativity. This ends up in Shark writing excruciatingly bad poetry, which both distracts him and also gives Matthias yet more to read.

Unfortunately, nearing the end of their seclusion, Zasu notices that all the food has run out and she's getting hangry! Luckily, Matthias has a clever plan! Completely strung out and high on himself, he stalks outside of the safehouse, through the shadows, to a small market to buy everyone some cabbages.

Besides dealing with all these issues, the crew spends their time on the mystical as well. Dick returns to the Song of the Djinn and learns how to Summon and Bind an Efreeti! He feels his connection with K'thuga strengthen as a result. Meanwhile, Lawrence learns how to Contact the elusive Mind of the Observer. Zasu reads their newly acquired tome of True Magick, filled with all sorts of folk magic, and tries to learn magical healing. Unfortunately she has not grapsed the intricacies and will have to practice for another week to try again. Matthias, in an uncharacteristic worry over his own Sanity, does not delve deeper into the unknown.

Short Round, also present in the safehouse and wearily observing the investigators, has been busy translating a [[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/China Clues#[CH5] Excerpts from the Order\|notebook they stole from Ho Fang]]. It seems to detail some catastrophic events in China, but also eludes to the Pale Viper 'opening the way' on the day the sun grows dark in the 14th year since the Hsuan-tung Emperor's fall. A quick reference learns that this most likely refers to the day of a solar eclipse on January 14th, 1926...

### Dateline: Saturday, April 11th, 1925
After 9 days of forced proximity, Jack Brady returns to the safehouse and tells them that the worst has blown over and they can probably get out now, if they keep their heads down! They move towards a different Firm Action warehouse, and Lawrence decide to Contact the Mind of the Observer. He feels his mind being cast out into the deep vastness of nothing, only to feel a slight tingling nudge. He returns to his body much the same and somewhat disappointed.

Jack has arranged 4 picketboats and around 20 Firm Action soldiers to assist in the raid of Grey Dragon Island. They talk tactics: Grey Dragon Island is around 16 hours away in the East China Sea. However, according to the sea maps, there is a nearby uninhabited island to mount the assault from. They discuss whether to approach in light or dark conditions, knowing that the treacherous reefs around Grey Dragon Island will make a night time approach hazardous. They briefly consider bringing smaller rubber boats along to avoid crashing, but in the end decide to keep that as a plan B. Everyone gears up and they head to the boats the next day!

### Dateline: Sunday, April 12th, 1925
The group, with Firm Action operatives, travels by boat to the staging island. They find it without problems and decide to bed down for the evening, planning to leave again a few hours before dawn to head to Grey Dragon Island.

In the night, Lawrence suddenly gets nudged awake. Someone is looming over him. As his eyes adjust to the dark, Lawrence sees a man in a fine suit, with his slick hair parted neatly in the center. It takes a few seconds, but then Lawrence suddenly recognizes him! It's Matthias' friend from the from New York to London: Arthurian scholar Jimothy.

Jimothy smiles at Lawrence.
"You called for me?"
