# Active Threads of Investigation

## Clive’s Story
- They were sent here by Gavigan to work together with the Egyptian Brotherhood to find the secret mummy and steal it away to a ceremonial chamber underneath the pyramids for a ritual. al-Shakti never told the Clive Expedition the location of the secret tunnels.
- The ritual requires the Crown, Necklace and Girdle. The Crown is in al-Shakti’s possession and they found the Necklace on the mummy. They also expected to find the Girdle but to their surprise it wasn’t there.
- The ritual also requires a spiritual conduit. The Clive Expedition have brought Agatha Broadmoor along to serve as this conduit.
- In waiting for the time to perform the ritual, Clive believes the artefacts are either stored in the ceremonial chamber with the mummy or on al-Shakti’s plantation.
- When the ritual can be performed, the best time to do it is at the night of the new moon.

## On Queen Nitocris
- You’ve learned from Dr. Ali Kafour that queen Nitocris was a cruel queen who ruled Egypt in the 6th Dynasty. According to legends she followed the Black Pharaoh. Her reign was reportedly so cruel that in the end she was buried alive in a secret and unknown tomb
- One of the items Faraz Najjar stole from Omar al-Shakti and sold to Roger Carlyle was a golden circlet set with a large zircon. Dr. Kafour mentioned that matches the description of Queen Nitocris’ crown
- The Order of Akmallah has told you they protect an evil artefact that’s said to have been a girdle owned by Queen Nitocris. They’ve mentioned a prophecy that the evil queen could be resurrected if all three of her adornments are gathered: the Crown, the Girdle and the Necklace. The Necklace’s whereabouts are unknown
- You’re working under the assumption that the mysterious mummy that the Clive Expedition found was Queen Nitocris, and the Necklace may have been on her body.

## On the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh
- You’ve learned that the Egyptian Brotherhood is led by a man named Omar al-Shakti who lives in Gezira Mohammed, a small town near Cairo.
- The blood orgy ritual of the Carlyle Expedition, as described by Warren Besart, was attended by a man who fits Faraz Najjar’s description of Omar al-Shakti.
- According to Faraz Najjar, the Brotherhood has an interest in the Mosque of Ibn Tulun for unknown reasons. At the Mosque you noticed that one of the ulaam, Ahmed al-Dhahabi, had some weird tattoos on his body and a mysterious door in his office. Your snooping pissed him off, however, and he shooed you out. You later found out that he’s a holy warrior of the Order of Akmallah: a group descended from an ancient cult of Isis.
- The day after visiting the Mosque, Shark and Elliot were attacked by 2 Brotherhood cultists. You’ve stolen their pendants.
- You’ve learned from Ahmed al-Dhahabi that Brotherhood cultists have tried to steal the evil artefact in their care recently. The mujahideen rebuked them and they have taken their minds.
- On the road to El Wasta you were followed by cultists. You took their vehicle out.

## On the Black Pharaoh
- The Black Pharaoh has been named as Nyarlathotep, an Outer God. The mask you took from the Ju-Ju House has depictions of other Outer Gods: Azathoth, Nodens, Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Nigurath. Nodens is said to oppose Nyarlathotep’s plans.
- According to legends, Nephren-Ka’s body was entombed in the Bent Pyramid in Dahshur. The nearby Red Pyramid was said to guard the land if Nephren-Ka should ever rise again.
- According to Warren Besart, all the members of the Carlyle Expedition except Jack Brady at one point disappeared into the Bent Pyramid. When they re-emerged, they were jubilant about something and later held a blood orgy in the desert near Meidum.
- A mental patient (Ubaid) at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun freaked out when he saw Dick and mentioned that the Black Pharoah has his soul. Further questioning revealed that Ubaid sees a Dark Man standing behind Dick, with his heart in his hand. He has seen this before with the Carlyle Expedition. He urged you to visit his mother Nuri in El Wasta, who is the only one who can save Dick’s soul.
- When visiting El Wasta, Nuri drew you a map to a nearby oasis. There you found a fragment of limestone with a sigil of an ankh and the Eye of Horus on it. You gather that it’s some sort of protective ward, but what it exactly does is unknown. Lawrence determined that it’s made from a type of limestone often used in pyramid facings and that this fragment had a pink cast to it.

## On the Clive Expedition
- The Clive Expedition is funded by the Penhew Foundation and came to Egypt in October 1924 to dig at the Pyramid of Mycerinus on the Giza plateau
- In December they uncovered a secret tomb that held an unknown female mummy. A few days after the find, the mummy and sarcophagus were stolen from the pyramid and the policemen guarding it have gone missing. It’s a complete mystery how this all could have happened.
- Soon after, the Clive Expedition left the plateau of Giza and moved their dig site to Memphis, where they currently still are.
- Before the move, they fired one of the archeologists: Jan-Willem van Heuvelen. He is still somewhere in Cairo. Your guide Saleem is looking for his whereabouts.
