### Dateline: Tuesday, January 20th, 1925
In the morning, Lawrence finds a letter in his mailbox from Rebecca Shosenberg. She has provided him with the telephone number of Margaret Hillsbrow, widow of Solomon Discrol - the first of the Forehead-Carving Murders. Additionally, Rebecca has arranged for Lawrence and the group to meet on wednesday morning with Millie Adams, the wife of Hilton Adams who has been convicted for the murders and is currently on death row in Sing Sing Prison. The meeting is to take place in the Lafayette Theater in Harlem.

The group decides to spend their morning in the Hall of Records, looking through publicly available information to aid them in their investigation. They uncover the following information:

- The abandoned building next to the Ju-Ju House is owned by the Bennett Real Estate Company;
- Erica Carlyle, sister to Roger Carlyle, is the only living Carlyle and as such has ownership of the Carlyle Company, which has businesses in transportation, munitions and international trade;
    - Zasu remembers from her socialite days that Erica Carlyle frequently attended exclusive parties, galas and charity events. A quick check of New York’s social calendar reveals that a charity auction for the benefit of underprivileged children in the Fitz-Carlton Hotel coming thursday evening will also receive Erica as a guest;
    - Using her known contacts, and a Peruvian artefact gifted by Lawrence, Zasu manages to land an invite to the auction for her and two additional attendees
- Public records of the members of the Carlyle Expedition yield the following connections
    - *Roger Carlyle*: Erica Carlyle is his only living relative
    - *Robert Huston*: Father and a brother are living in Chicago. A second brother, Samuel Huston, lives in New York and works as a dermatologist
    - *Aubrey Penhew*: No records, as he is from the UK
    - *Hypatia Masters*: Her parents, living in upstate New York, are her only living relatives. They own the Masters Armaments Company.
    - *Jack Brady*: No known living relatives. His previously known address is in California
- There are several Walter Robsons living in New York, it’d take a good part of the day to check them all to find Captain Robson of the 14th Precinct.

In the afternoon, Lawrence, Dick and Shark make their way to Sing Sing Prison while flurries of snow start to fall from the heavens. They’re led to the Death House, where subwarden George Brunton allows them a 30 minute conversation with Hilton Adams. Hilton Adams is a well-spoken, polite man who tells them his story:

After Hilton returned from the war in 1919, he started to notice that Harlem locals began to disappear. As the disappearances increased, they brought this information to the police (the 14th precinct), who refused to take the matter seriously. Therefore, Hilton and his war friends decided to start patrolling the streets themselves.

These patrols did not sit well with the police, who warned them to not stir up any trouble. Meanwhile, Harlem locals began whispering different theories about the disappearances, and the word ‘cult’ was whispered more often than not. Hilton and his friends investigated the cult angle and found mention of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue from Kenya. The only place in Harlem connected to Kenya is the Ju-Ju House. At this point, the investigators mention they know of the cult and the Ju-Ju House, but that they’re keeping a safe distance. Hilton Adams is surprised about the group’s knowledge, and commends their safety - something he feels he should’ve been more careful with himself.

Hilton mentions he saw patterns in the disappearances: every month around the time of the new moon, 2 to 3 people would disappear. The people disappeared from all over Harlem, but not within a 2 block radius of the area the Ju-Ju House is in. When the murders started happening, Hilton noticed there was no real pattern in timing or location (except that they all happened in Harlem, with the exception of Jackson’s murder) and feels the murders were more reactive than planned.

Hilton was surveilling the Ju-Ju House every now and then, but one day he noticed a tall, muscular and bald African man exiting the Ju-Ju House, even though Hilton had been observing for a few hours and hadn’t seen him come in. He decided to follow the man to a coffeeshop. After the man left, he asked around in the coffeeshop but was met with fear and a warning to just walk away from this line of inquiry. He did get the name of the man though: *Mukunga M’Dari*.

That night, as Hilton was patrolling, he heard a scream from an alley. When he rushed towards it - it couldn’t have been 10 seconds - he found a dead, disemboweled man with his forehead carved up. Within seconds thereafter, he was arrested by the police for the murder. Hilton comments on how it’s odd that the police were there instantly, considering they basically never patrol those streets at night, and how he feels they must’ve been standing ready for him. Basically, Hilton feels the man was murdered just in order to frame him. The key piece of evidence, Hilton’s knife covered in the murdered man’s blood, was faked, as Hilton would never take his knife with him when out on patrol; he takes his gun!

After the end of his tale, the group asks him about any appeals that might be going on since the murder of Jackson Elias. Saddened, Hilton says that there’s no more money for any appeals. The group promises to find a way to grant him another appeal. Hilton thanks the group, but also comments that this will probably be the last time he’ll see the group. As a last word of advice, he urges the group to talk to his wife Millie. Knowing her, she probably did some snooping around herself. Lawrence, Dick and Shark take their leave of Sing Sing Prison and drive back home through a rising blizzard. On the way back, they drop by Carlton Ramsey who agrees to take on a new appeal for Hilton Adams at a reduced rate.

Meanwhile, back in New York, Zasu makes some phone calls! First she calls the Bennett Real Estate Company, asking about whether the property next to the Ju-Ju House is for sale or rent. Employee Jolanda informs her that the old pawn shop is indeed for rent, and the two quickly agree to meet this afternoon to draw up the lease. When asked for her name, Zasu exceeds herself by coming up with the pseudonym Anita Fakename.

Next she calls Margaret Hillsbrow, wondering if she could ask some questions about her deceased husband. Margaret agrees and the two set to meet tomorrow morning. Finally a call is made to Samuel Huston, and an appointment to meet tomorrow morning is made as well.

Zasu and Matthias make their way to the Bennett Real Estate Company and meet with Jolanda. Posing as the loving, just-married couple Quinten and Anita Fakename, they quickly sign the lease. They notice that the rent is very low, and Jolanda seemed to not talk highly of the property, but they don’t prod further.

Then, on their way back home through the blizzard, Zasu notices that they’re being followed by a ruddy looking Asian man. What’s worse: they think they see a strip of red cloth poking out of his coat pocket, reminiscent of the ones Jackson’s murderers were wearing. Zasu and Matthias quickly head into the nearby university building and manage to shake their tail. They quickly call Elliot back at the Hotel Chelsea, and he gathers the just-returned Dick, Shark and Lawrence to come to the rescue.

At the university, the group quickly spots the pursuer walking around aimlessly in the university grounds, where any other person would be rushing to take shelter. They devise a ruse where they pretend to be running to take shelter themselves - but when they come up to the man, Shark grabs him in a bear hug while Dick clumsily pulls a black hood over his face. Then Elliot comes marching up to ram his fists in the man’s stomach, after which he collapses with a grunt. They search his pockets and find a headband with a red cloth, a large knife as used by Jackson’s murderers, and a note that has the names and addresses of Zasu, Matthias, Lawrence and Elliot on it. As most of their homes are compromised, the group decides to load the man up in Talulah and head to Shark’s house.

At Shark’s interesting home, he provides everyone with a lovely cup of tea before starting the interrogation of the cultist. They find this cultist less zealous and insane than Jackson’s murderers, and get a good deal of information out of him:

- The Cult serves the *Many-Faced God*, and they are promised wealth and power by doing so
- The Many-Faced God lives in the earth below the Ju-Ju House
- The Cult is led by the high priest of the Many-Faced God: *Mukunga M’Dari*
- Every new moon, the Many-Faced God is fed two chosen people, who are blessed to join it. This will happen again soon, for the new moon will be in the sky coming saturday and sunday…
- The murders are not for the Many-Faced God, they are the punishment for those who dare cross the Cult
- The carving on the forehead is made so that after dying, the souls of the murdered are fed to The Bloody Tongue
- The Bloody Tongue is a terrible and terrifying entity that thrives on pain and despair, it birthed the Many-Faced God to the local cult, and the Many-Faced God is part of The Bloody Tongue
- The cultist was tasked to follow Zasu, because her grandiose speech at Jackson’s funeral about casting down evil cults angered M’Dari, and he wanted to know whether she was a real threat or not
- The cult bribes the police to turn a blind eye to their activities. Different officers collect the bribes, but he doesn’t know who’s at their head

After the investigators feel they’ve learned all they can, there’s unfortunately no way they can allow this cultist to return to the cult. He is dealt with.

Finally, the group ponders as to why Dick and Shark weren’t on the cultist’s list. Then it dawns on them: after Jackson’s murder, Dick and Shark weren’t taken into police custody. It seems someone on the police force has leaked their info to the cult, but who? Captain Robson? Commissioner Johnson? Lieutenant Poole? It seems the group must now tread carefully.
