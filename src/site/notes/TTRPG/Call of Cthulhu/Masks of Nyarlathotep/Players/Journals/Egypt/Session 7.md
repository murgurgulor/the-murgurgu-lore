### Dateline: Monday, February 23rd, 1925
After their harrowing night, the investigators contemplate their next move. At 17:00 this day, Dr. Henry Clive and Martin Winfield will distract Omar al-Shakti’s attention, giving the group a shot at locating the ritual chamber. Two tasks need to be fulfilled before then: they want to ask Dr. Kafour to enchant one of their weapons with the scroll, and they need to locate Nessim Efti and the Girdle of Nitocris. After deciding that Shark’s handgun (Sally) will be blessed, the group splits up.

Matthias and Shark head to the Egyptian Museum and meet with Dr. Kafour. At the prospect of talking about magic and reading ancient scrolls, he is most excited and leads the two into the museum’s vaults for a private gathering. After skimming the scroll, they learn that the spell makes a weapon extend into the Eldritch Realm, making it especially efficient in combating creatures from that realm. They also find out that the spell requires both a blood sacrifice and a spiritual sacrifice. The blood sacrifice would ideally be of an intelligent creature, but Dr. Kafour would prefer to stray away from human sacrifice. Matthias and Shark set out to the markets to find an octopus while Dr. Kafour prepares the ritual.

Meanwhile, Zasu, Lawrence and Dick head to the hospital to see Ahmed al-Dhahabi. They find the old imam severely wounded. Ahmed tells them how a great serpentine shadow attacked the mosque and destroyed all of it, but luckily they were forewarned by Dick and Nessim Efti had left the premises with the Girdle and the Sword of Akmallah before the attack happened. Ahmed warns the group that the Brotherhood has eyes on the hospital and gives them a cryptic hint: Efti can be found in the street where Isis flies. Zasu recollects that Isis was commonly depicted as a kite (bird, not toy). The group successfully sneaks out of the hospital undetected and goes looking for the Street of Kites. They enlist the help of Magnificent Abdul, a random tour guide on the streets. With just the right amount of money, he agrees to lead the way.

In the Street of Kites the group locates a holy symbol of Isis on one of the houses and they enter. Inside the small house they find Efti, bloodied and beaten, in a backroom. Fortunately, he is clutching the Girdle and Sword tightly in his hands. Language barriers spoil a lengthy monologue from Efti in Arabic, but through body language an intuition Zasu manages to interpret that he’s trying to say that it’s time for a younger generation - the investigators - to pick up the mantle of Isis and protect the world against evil. He offers the Sword and Girdle to the group, and bids them to leave before the Brotherhood finds them. Dick determines the Girdle holds no sinister attraction to him with the warding stone on his chest and is pleased. They thank Efti and head out, bringing the Magnificent Abdul along.

After an off-screen octopus chase through Cairo’s alleys, Matthias and Shark get back to Dr. Kafour with the animal. They find him nearly nude, sweaty and covered in chalk in the room where they left him, with arcane markings, runes and magic circles drawn over nearly every surface. To share the spiritual sacrifice, Matthias and Shark are asked to disrobe as well and are marked with chalk. Then the gun is placed on the ground and Matthias holds the octopus over it. Kafour enters a deep chant and at the height of the spell, Shark plunges a blade into the octopus, spilling its blood over the gun and most of Matthias. As a sacrifice, they find their willpower whittled away slightly. The ritual is complete, however, and Sally is blessed. The two help Dr. Kafour tidy up the mess and reconvene in the hotel.

Back at the hotel, Zasu gifts Matthias the Sword of Akmallah. He is moved to tears. The group gathers supplies for pyramid spelunking - including dynamite, a whip, and a fancy hat - and asks the Magnificent Abdul to guide them to Giza. They load up in Bomani and drive out to the plateau. There, the Magnificent Abdul leads them to another guide: the Wonderful Ahmed. They spot a familial similarity between the two men. Luckily, it seems the Wonderful Ahmed has a special guided tour of the pyramid of Mycerinus that goes by the hidden tomb of the stolen mummy.

The group enters the pyramid and find themselves in claustrophobically narrow passages. Wonderful Ahmed guides them through a labyrinth of hallways, but Shark makes sure to keep a mental note of the way so they can find it back if needed. After half an hour of traveling through the pyramid, they come upon the hidden tomb. Wonderful Ahmed spins a tale of how the mummy wasn’t stolen but wandered out by itself, as it was cursed by an evil demon who posed as a pharaoh in Egypt’s past. To enforce his story, he shows the group some hieroglyphs on the walls that depict a Black Pharaoh and a kite attacking it. The Black Pharaoh seems to hold a mysterious staff in one of the depictions.

### Black Pharaoh Hieroglyphs

The group sends the guides away, claiming that they intend to stay the night here due to a lost bet. After some protest, Wonderful Ahmed and Magnificent Abdul leave the investigators be. The group, including James Gardner, immediately sets out to inspect the walls for hidden secrets. After 10 minutes of searching they manage to find an illusively hidden panel that slides away to reveal a pressable stone. When the stone is pressed, a portion of wall slides away to reveal a hidden passage!

The group heads into the passage and travels deep underground, until they finally emerge in a stone hallway. Where the main passageway is man-made an hewn from rock, there are many natural small tunnels branching off left and right. Shortly after they enter, they hear an inhuman screech echoing from somewhere deep in the tunnels.

Making their way through the main passageway, Shark suddenly finds a drop of blood dripping on his face. Close inspection of the surroundings reveal no source, however. Then the group comes to a split. They decide to look for indications of where to go, and Zasu - fully in her pyramid revelry - detects dragmarks on the passage to the right. Concluding that that must be the direction in which they dragged the sarcophagus, the group heads down the right corridor. They observe some claw marks here and there on the walls.

After another 20 minutes of walking, the corridor opens up into a large arch. The arch is decorated with hundreds of faces screaming in agony, with monstrous beings descending down on them. The top of the arch is decorated with several phases of the moon, with the new moon being at the top of the arch. Beyond the arch, a large set of stairs descends even deeper into the ground. The group sneaks their way down and find themselves in an enormous hall, extending 40-50 meters to each side, and extending further into darkness with no end to be seen. Scattered throughout the hall are massive black pillars reaching up high to support a ceiling that is equally lost to the darkness. Only several torches are lit in this hall, and the sickly disturbed maroon flames reflect off the black marble that makes up the floor and walls of this hall.

### Great Chamber of Nyarlathotep

Matthias fears that evil creatures might be crawling and lurking on the unseen ceiling above and asks Lawrence to make a flash photograph to illuminate the top. Lawrence obliges, and in the flash of his camera the group sees that the pillars don’t actually support the ceiling at all but all end in twisting and crooked branches, interlocking with one another and somehow waving back and forth in some unseen and unfelt wind.

After the afterglow of the flash dies down, the group hears another inhuman screech. Closer, this time, coming from further down in the marble hall.

It seems they have been noticed…
