	- Professor Cowles explained his lecture was about the Cult of the Sand Bat, a Polynesian cult that he had investigated.

	- Professor Cowles also showed some slides of weathered monolithic blocks of stone ([[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Images/New York Images#Professor Cowles' Slides\|Images of Professor Cowles' Slides]]). The slides were taken by a man called **Arthur MacWhirr** in Western Australia in 1921. After MacWhirr died from pneumonia, his estate was given over to Prof. Cowles for academic purposes by **Robert Mackenzie**, executor of MacWhirr's testament in **Port Hedland**.
	- Professor Cowles is currently working in the Miskatonic University in Arkham until October, but his friend **David Dodge** takes care of his stuff - including MacWhirr's possessions - back home in **Sydney**.
- There have been several mentions of **Robert Huston**, Roger Carlyle's psychiatrist and member of the Carlyle Expedition, being in Australia digging up strange technologies. His shipments have gone through **Randolph Shipping Co.** in **Darwin**.
