### Dateline: Thursday, February 5th, 1925
The gang wakes up, returns the old fisherman’s boat, and then decides to head back to London. They won’t travel to Henson Manufacturing in Derby, confident that the police will deal with whatever is going on there based on Gary Umberton’s statement. Shark does some cool car maneuvers.

Back in the Savoy Hotel, they reconnect with a severely hungover Elliot. He’s been on a bender with Cocktail Mike for the past few days, getting in all sorts of trouble but ultimately inventing the best drink ever. Unfortunately as Elliot woke up this morning he doesn’t remember the recipe, and Cocktail Mike has mysteriously disappeared…

The group goes to meet Zahra Shafik at Empire Spices. The fumes and scents inside are almost intoxicating, as is Ms Shafik’s aura. She readily admits that she’s known about the investigators’ existence and has been expecting them for some time. She is also aware of Gavigan’s death, but is unmoved by it. The group finds it difficult to concentrate while talking to her with all the stuffy aromas muddling their minds and they decide to head out. Zahra comes along without a struggle.

Out on the streets, the conversation continues and Zahra says that Gavigan befouled the nature of the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh. Like all British pigs, he took something from a culture that wasn’t his and used it for his own ego and gains. She tries to explain that the Brotherhood is a benevolent society that only wants what’s good for the world: the return of the Black Pharaoh. Ages ago, the Black Pharaoh was apparently banished from this plane of existence by some other forces. The Brotherhood is striving to create a way for him to return, so he can return humanity to the state it’s meant to be in: no separation between life or death, just one continued existence. When questioned on how they plan to return the Black Pharaoh, Zahra gives no clear answer. She denies that time is of importance, and neither are phases of the moon. Dick, however, discerns that Zahra is not telling the truth here: he suspects that there is a timetable.

Matthias has a suspicion that Zahra might be the woman Roger Carlyle was entranced by and who convinced him to launch the Carlyle Expedition. Matthias calls her ‘bunny’ and ‘Anastasia’, but it seems that Zahra doesn’t apply any of these names to herself. When threatened with death, Zahra is coy and says that she doesn’t fear death: one day the Black Pharaoh will return, and then the distinction between life and death is irrelevant. She claims to not be immortal and cuts herself as evidence.

The group discusses what to do with Zahra. Even though she doesn’t seem to pose an immediate tangible threat, she does seem to be one of the more prominent and dangerous cultists they’ve encountered so far, based on her knowledge, beliefs and her possible mind control abilities. For the sake of the world, they decide that she must die. They head back into the shop and find a simpleton named Edjo sweeping the floors. Lawrence takes Edjo out for a coffee, and Elliot decides to punch Zahra in the face. As blood starts flowing from her nose, Shark plunges a knife in her throat. A wry smile forms on her face as she utters her last words: “All hail the Dark Man.”

With Zahra dead, Dick decide to obscure the evidence and cover their tracks while Lawrence sends Edjo home for an early weekend. The group makes an exit through the back and return to their hotel.

The group wires Carlton Ramsey with the request for a journey to Egypt. While Carlton arranges the visas, boat tickets, various firearms permits et cetera on the stateside, the group goes to wrap up some last chores over the next few days:

- Matthias heads to Jimothy and gets the name of an acquainted blacksmith who can alter his newly acquired suit of armor. He also shows Jimothy the books they’ve borrowed from the Misr House. Jimothy dismisses most of them as inane occult drivel, but picks out an old tome in Arabic that piques his interest: the [[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Tomes and Artefacts/England/Song of the Djinn\|TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Tomes and Artefacts/England/Song of the Djinn]]. Jimothy is willing to translate, summarise and annotate the volume for Matthias;
- Dick attempts to learn the Chant of Thoth, but fails to understand the ritual. He can try again in a week after some renewed studying;
- Matthias performs the Chant of Thoth and opens his mind to knowledge. This time, however, his perception changes as well: he sees the joins of the floor and walls of the hotel room shift and disalign, and from the spaces newly created he sees an ethereal violet mist emerging, slowly extending thin tendrils that wrap around the walls, almost carressing or stroking them. A split second later, the angles snap back into place. No one else saw anything. Matthias then succeeds in learning how to [[TTRPG/Games/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Spells/Contact the Mind of the Observer\|TTRPG/Games/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Spells/Contact the Mind of the Observer]]. He decides to hold off on casting it until he has more information on who or what the Observer is;

### Dateline: Tuesday, February 10th, 1925
After all the chores have been completed, it’s time for the group to board the boat in Southampton to Port Said, Egypt! Thanks to favourable winds, the journey will only take 7 days.

During the boat journey the group gets wrapped up in a mystery! Different passengers appear to receive anonymous love letters, only to be haunted the following night by flickering lights, spooky noises and ghastly appearances! One of the passengers, a magician, was taken captive in the brig on suspicions of being the perpetrator. Wanting to get to the bottom of this, Matthias and Zasu stage a break-up and act heartbroken and forlorn, looking for someone to love with a similar interest in pyramids. Their ploy ends with a musical number called “It’s lonely at the tip”.

As the love ghost attempts to match Matthias and Zasu up, they spring a trap on him and capture the fiend! It turns out to be the former captain of the ship who was fired for pranking passengers, and this is his way of taking revenge. He would have gotten away with it, if it wasn’t for those meddling middle-aged men and women!

In the aftermath, it turned out that no other passenger on the boat really cared all that much. They thought the love letters were a nice service the boat crew provided for the passengers. However, the falsely accused magician - The Incredible Ur - is released from captivity and is very greatful to the group. He gifts them a mysterious silver coin, which is a token of being owed a favour by the Magician’s Guild. If they are ever in need of help, they can seek out a magician and offer this coin. The Incredible Ur then mysteriously disappears…
