### Dateline: Saturday, March 28th, 1925

After docking in Hong Kong, the group disembarks the Ivory Wind. Shark finally gets out of the engine room where he spent the whole trip, and Matthias is visibly suffering of lack of personal care and hygiene, having grown a messy beard, bushy eyebrows, and a pugnant odour. Shark updates Matthias’ books to reflect the changes.

Seeing as Hong Kong seems like a good place to get some chores done, the group splits up. Dick and Lawrence visit an enthusiastic pharmacist to analyse the contents of the cigarette Ssassathassaa gave Lawrence, after which Dick and Matthias set out to find an iron torch fit to enchant with the eternal flame of K’tugah. They end up going for a gaudy dragon-headed option. Dick also persuades the fire department to sell him some of their fireproof outfits.

Shark and Zasu team up and go weapon shopping. Zasu upgrades her Derringer to a 9mm handgun and also outfits her hair with a deadly pin for use in case of emergencies. They then telegram Carlton Ramsey to arrange the paperwork for their gun licenses in Shanghai.

The group reconvenes and rents a car to drive out to a quarry to perform the [[Enchantment of the Living Flame\|Enchantment of the Living Flame]]. Dick dresses in his fireman’s suit and starts chanting. During the hours of his chant he feels an increasing pressure and unbearable heat in his head. Just when he thinks he can’t take it anymore and expects the flames to erupt from his ears and nose, he sneezes. The dragon-head torch comes alight with the eternal flame, which Dick channels through himself from K’tugah. Interestingly enough the flame changes colours depending on Dick’s mood. They then demonstrate the eternal flame’s capacities by turning it into a flamethrower and melting the Crown of Nitocris to molten slag.

Content, the group heads back to find a translator and guide for their Chinese adventure. They head to the Archeology department to find a willing student. Zasu and Shark try an elaborate performative scheme to no success, but Matthias fills in the proper forms and is soon greeted with a young man who introduces himself as Li Wen-Chung, although his friends call him Short Round. He was recommended for the position of aiding Dr. Von Zinkelfurt, as he has been studying the works of American archeologist Dr. Jones. Short Round happily joins the group, and is particularly infatuated with Zasu.

Finally, the group heads back to the pharmacist who explains that he found a compound in the tobacco that is some form of dimethyltryptamine. Lawrence recalls that in layman’s terms this would be called DMT, and provides the ingester with powerful hallucinations and delusions. The pharmacist also explains that he found a different substance in the tobacco, but that he was unable to identify it and muses that it might be an unknown molecule. The group takes the rest of the [[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Tomes and Artefacts/China/Serpent's Cigarette\|Serpent's Cigarette]] and leaves.

In the evening the group beds down in their hotel. Dick is alarmed to find a potato peel in his pillowcase and discusses the serpentine implications with Lawrence. Shark quietly laughs himself to sleep, clutching a half-peeled potato.

### Dateline: Sunday, March 29th, 1925
The group, joined by Short Round, travels to Shanghai by train. It takes most of the day. They settle in the British-American Concession in a mediocre hotel by the name of the Best Western Hemisphere Hotel. They show the employees a picture of Jack Brady but they don’t recognize him, nor have they heard of the Stumbling Tiger Bar.

Following up on their other lead, they take a walk down the Bund. There, Zasu spots the ship from Jackson Elias’ photograph! The ship is a yacht named ‘Dark Mistress’ and it’s flying a Union Jack. They spot the captain standing on the prow of the ship, and the man looks awful. His skin is pale and sagging and his nose is covered in ulcers and necrosis. He appears to be selectively balding, with large patches of bare skin in between swaths of black hair. The sailors of the yacht are busy loading some crates, and they also look singularly strange: although their bodies are rail tin, they have prominent creases and folds in their neck that supports a narrow face with bulging, watery eyes and a flat nose. Both forehead and chin are receding, and the lips are uncommonly voluptuous.

Dick and Matthias head to the harbormaster’s office and bribe a clerk to gain more information. They find out that the yacht is registerd to one Alfred Penhurst. It usually comes in once per two or three weeks, and loads up on cargo from Ho Fang Imports/Exports. It never stays more than a day, usually sailing back in the late evening. The captain only comes on land to register at the office, and the crew has never been seen mingling with others or going to a bar. The yacht’s home port is listed as a private, unnamed island in the East China Sea. Upon request, the clerk recalls Jackson Elias visiting the office half a year ago, with inquiries to the same ship.

As the group prepares to leave the riverside, Shark suddenly realizes a similarity between the appearance of the sailors and an illustration he once saw in one of Matthias’ tomes. The illustration was of monstrous fish-like creatures called [[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Images/China Images#Image of Deep Ones\|Deep Ones]], an amphibious race that live in cyclopean underwater cities and revere the Outer God Cthulhu. Smugly, he shares this information with the group.

Leaving the Bund, the group heads to their next location: the Stumbling Tiger Bar.
