### Dateline: Tuesday, April 14th, 1925
Jack Brady brings the group towards their safehouse. He tells them to rest up. He's going to see Mei-Ling and 'do something about his arm'. The group reconvenes with Short Round and gives him a vague approximation of the events that occurred on Grey Dragon Island. They review their [[TTRPG/Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Journals/Australia/Australia Leads\|Australia Leads]] and decide to head to Darwin by boat first, making a stop by Hong Kong first to see Roger Carlyle. Short Round stays on as their intern/chronicler of Matthias' adventures and sets off to make arrangements. He finds a ship that leaves in 3 days.

### Dateline: Wednesday, April 15th, 1925
Jack Brady meets the group. His right arm has been severed at the shoulder, but Jack insists he's alright. He explains that his plans are to take it easy for now. Maybe he'll buy a farm with Mei-Ling and live a peaceful life. He also asks the investigators that, if they encounter Hypatia 'Patty' Masters and she's alive and well, to do anything they can to save her. Penhew and Huston were nutters, and M'Weru and evil scheming bitch, but Patty never did anything wrong, she was just along for the photography and to support Roger.

He then takes the group to see his acquaintance Mr. Mu, a scholar of ancient Chinese esoteric history. Mr. Mu has translated the ancient Seven Cryptical Texts of Hsan, an old text that speaks of different dimensions, travel between those dimensions, and the horrible entities that exist in them. How Jack got his hands on these scrolls is unclear, but it probably wasn't very legal.

Mr. Mu explains the following:
- There are many different dimensions, each with their own natural laws and physics.
- Travel between these dimensions is possible through interdimensional cracks, but creatures/entities traveling to a different dimension have to adjust to the destination's natural laws and physics. This makes their existence in other dimensions incomplete or altered. 
- There can also be parts of the entities that don't translate well into our physics, and our brain tries to make sense of them using the senses we have. This means some of these entities might only be perceived as a smell, or a feeling or emotion.
- The thing known as Nyarlathotep is from a different dimension (or maybe it is a dimension itself? That's unknown) and for some reason it has taken an interest in our dimension. It has tried to exert its will on us by moving through the cracks between the two dimensions, but conforming to our natural law has forced it into a physical shape. This shape differs between cultures and times: in Egypt it was the Black Pharaoh, in China it was the Bloated Woman, in England it was the Dark Man, in Kenya it was the Bloody Tongue, et cetera. One common denominator is that our brain apparently always perceives Nyarlathotep as a maddening, monstrous entity.
- Being forced to conform to our physics, Nyarlathotep's powers are weakened and it has been shown that it can be driven away again by wizards from our dimension.
- Mu's theory is that Nyarlathotep wants to take drastic measures to exert its will on us: it wants to break down the barrier between the dimesions and pull us into its reality. This means we have to conform to its natural law, which probably would turn our world into one of chaos, madness, impossible landscapes and unspeakable terrors.
- To achieve this, Nyarlathotep would make use of 3 components:
	1. Existing rifts between the dimensions would have to be widened by cultists. In earlier history these rifts had been locked by wizards, but it seems those locks have been broken (for example when Roger Carlyle broke the one on the Red Pyramid in Egypt). One other such rift was on Grey Dragon Island in the form of the Statue of the Bloated Woman. It can be assumed that burying it deeply in lava has successfully prevented cultists from accessing this rift.
	2. A large amount of energy and magical force would have to disrupt the fabric of our reality in order to open a gateway. It seems that this is what Aubrey Penhew has been planning with his strange missile, and it seems that this, for now, has been thwarted.
	3. Nyarlathotep would need an anchor to latch on to. That anchor must be something that is both of itself and of this dimension. Matthias gathers this must be a child of some sorts.
- If all of these points are prevented, Nyarlathotep won't be able to fulfill its plan. If only parts of it are prevented, it might be able to break through in some lesser way.

Mr. Mu tells of a ritual that can reinstate the rift locks that the cultists have broken. It's called the Ritual of the Eye of Light and Darkness. The half-piece of stone Dick has strapped to his chest is a broken Eye of Light and Darkness. The ritual goes as follows:
- On the day before a full moon, engrave an eye in a hard natural substance and place it on the place to be warded
- When the full moon rises, the blood of an innocent - which is someone who has not been tainted by encounters of other dimensions - must fill the pupil of the eye. The blood must be fresh.
- At the same time, the warlocks participating in the ritual must start chanting 'SA-MA SA-MA TE-YO SA-MA' until dawn.
- Every hour until dawn, fresh blood from an innocent must fill the pupil of the eye again. The innocent does not need to die.
- While the ritual is taking place, power from the soul of the participating warlocks is leeched into the eye. The power that is leeched is set, so the more warlocks participate, the less the individual cost to one's soul is.
- When the first rays of dawn strike the eye, it briefly glows. The ward is then in effect. Breaking the ward is a difficult and unique process that will most likely take centuries of research to accomplish.

Finally, Mr. Mu speaks of the Dreamlands:
- The Dreamlands are the space in between dimensions. There is no natural law or physics there, but rather every visitor should bring their own. Anything can happen in the Dreamlands as long as the visitor has enough power of mind to believe, visualise and desire the possibilities.
- In other words: if a person would visit the Dreamlands, they would have to consciously belief that there is gravity holding them down, that there is visual input to see, that things they touch are real, et cetera. 
- Potentially someone could obtain god-like powers while in the Dreamlands, but that person would need to have the force of mind to know what that would be like, and to believe that they actually have that power. This would take a strong mind and lots of practice to achieve. 
- Travel to the Dreamlands is relatively easy, some even do it in their sleep!

The group considers these implications and devise a plan to become gods of the Dreamlands in order to destroy Nyarlathotep's dimension.

The group bids Mr. Mu farewell and heads back, with much to consider.

### Dateline: Saturday, April 18th, 1925
The group has packed up their belongings and board the ship to Hong Kong!

---
### Dateline: Monday, April 20th, 1925
The group has reached Hong Kong and the sanitarium where Roger Carlyle is interred under the name Randolph Carter. They meet with him. He's gaunt with sunken eyes and sallow skin, muttering to himself in the corner. He's speaking repeatedly of eyes seeing him, seeing all his secrets all the time. Matthias manages to slap some clarity into the man. 

Roger explains that, after he broke the ward on the Red Pyramid, they went into the Black Pharaoh's Sanctum in the Bent Pyramid. There, a way was opened into Nyarlathotep's realm. Nyarlathotep showed them the world he would create, and then made them watch as he impregnated Patty with its seed. Now, Roger rambles, she will bear his spawn and bring forth the herald of the world's end! He implores the investigators to find Patty and help her. She's with M'Weru in Kenya, in the Mountain of the Black Wind! Afterwards, Roger divulges into his insane babblings again.

The group composes a coded message to Carlton Ramsey to inform him of the location of Roger Carlyle, and to inform Erica Carlyle of his existence. Once they have dealt with the worldwide cults, Roger will be safe to return home again.

The group reboards the ship and continues on to Darwin.

### Dateline: Monday, April 27th, 1925
Well a week on board, the group is staring peacefully out over the ocean. Suddenly, Dick spots something! A single man in a small boat! The sailors of the boat haul him in and it turns out to be an emaciated castaway carrying a ball with a face painted on it. The man introduces himself as Dutch sailor Jozias Tuigstra and his ball as Willem. Their ship had sunk weeks earlier, and they're so happy to be rescued!
