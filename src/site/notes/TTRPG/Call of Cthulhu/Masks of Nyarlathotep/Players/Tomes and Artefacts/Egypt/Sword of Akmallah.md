Wielded by Nessim Efti of the Order of Akmallah, this magical sword has been handed down throughout the ages from the original Cult of Isis that the Order emerged from. Its keen blade need never be sharpened, and it cuts otherworldly horrors especially vicious.

When the sword is used to harm extradimensional creatures, it deals +1D4 damage.
