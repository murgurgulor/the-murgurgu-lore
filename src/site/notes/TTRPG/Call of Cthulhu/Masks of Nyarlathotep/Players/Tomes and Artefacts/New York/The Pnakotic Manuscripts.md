**Location:** Roger Carlyle’s Library.
**Physical Description:** Massive single volume with red leather binding. The translation date of 1485 does not correspond to the more recent binding material. No title on the cover, but the title page reveals the name with the subtitle “Translation and remarks from ancient Pnakotik Scrolls.” Marginal pencil notes in Carlyle’s hand visible at the beginning of the text. Several pages have had sections carefully removed, presumably illustrations.
**Author:** Unknown author and translator

##### Initial Reading
Written in a cumbersome Middle English dialect, this work translates a copy of The Pnakotic Scrolls (or Pnakotika)  that arrived with an unidentified refugee arriving from the collapsing Byzantine Empire. The translator, reportedly working with a second collaborator, offers scattered commentary and reference quotes from additional sources. The translation contains decorative headings for sections on Hyperborea, Atlantis, and Jupiter.

Scribbled marginal notes mention “City of the Great Race?” alongside a lengthy passage, as well as “A means to reach the mind of the Observer!” The speculative note marks a passage detailing the history of the source material, which was created from fragments uncovered in a library found in the “City of Pnakotus.”

While several parts and passages are the same as the copy the investigators possess, an Initial Reading shows parts and translations that are not included in their copy, as well as parts missing that their copy has. It seems to be a similar gathering but focused on different areas.

##### Full Study or Focused Reading
##### History of Pnakotic Manuscripts
Careful reading will reveal that some additional material has been added since the original translation date with subtle changes in style or language. It seems that the information contained within a large volume still represents only a small fraction of the many Pnakotic fragments passed amongst scholars, cultists, and collectors.

The translator reveals that portions of the original work have been reordered for clarity, as well as expresses introductory concerns about the effect of recurrent translations from the source material, which allegedly pre-date humankind.

##### Elder Script
Though it contains no examples of a separately described “Elder script”, the translator indicates that references will be provided to attribute material, which material originated in this distinct arcane language. When you encounter these passages, you sense of strong but distant connection to a strange creature. Continued attention to these passages may slowly form a vivid image of a barrel-shaped winged creature in the reader’s mind.

##### Terra Australis
After lengthy and exhaustive descriptions of various races, their inter-species and internecine conflicts, featuring extensive references to flying _pow-lips_, as well as the arrival and influence of their extraterrestrial gods. The reader will discover a passage referring to great cities hidden in a place described as both “Suprantarctic Domain” or “Terra Australis.”

##### The Purple Dome Temple
“Great power resides beneath the domed purple roof in Pnakotus. An observer spoke of a flesh servitor seeking to release energy by way of strange rituals. Unless prevented, great doom shall occur. “

##### Hyperborean History
Deeper in the book, pencils notes, and underlining from Carlyle disappear from the text, as the content begins to describe the events of ancient human history with detailed clarity, which seems advanced far beyond the understanding of contemporary historians. However, there are confusing references to the **Old Tribes of Lomah**, which originated in an Arctic continent. The text references a continent rising to Earth’s surface during the Miocene Epoch. However, the geologic time scale had not been introduced until 1913.

This violent tribe reportedly warred with a three-toed, fur-bearing race of intelligent cave-dwelling primates, which are referred to alternatively as the Voorii or **Voormi**. These howling subterranean creatures debased themselves by worshipping their somnolent lord, Tsathoggua, who required regular sacrifices.

In seeking to wipe out Tsathoggua’s minions, the tribal warband of Lomah pursued fleeing Voormi into the southern regions of Lower Lomar and Hyperborea, where they founded Olathoë and Commoriom, respectively. The remaining Voormi perished through continued tribal in-fighting, conflicts with the cannibalistic worshippers of Rhan-Tegoth, as well as consumption by an increasingly displeased Tsathoggua. Both Rhan-Tegoth and Tsathoggua apparently required a seemingly endless supply of sacrifices.

Additional passages in the text describe the arrival of Rhan-Tegoth, the Feasting One, from an extra-terrestrial place described as Yuggof. This monstrous creature resembles a strange insect-crab hybrid with a bulbous fleshy body and an elongated proboscis. Its worshippers consisted of Voormi, as well as some other strange six-limbed bipeds referred to as gnof-keh. With the fall of Hyperborea and the decimation of its feeding stock, Rhan-Tegoth descended into perpetual dormancy. Based on the manuscripts, this insatiable entity still rests somewhere,  lost in barren, frozen wastes.

##### Yithians
After a lengthy introduction on the **Yith**, who are reported to have brought sentience to humankind, you find a wide range of strange mathematical formulas, which include unusual and alien symbols, which do not correspond to contemporary mathematics. These formulas apply unconventional rules to geometry and time. Amongst these formulas is the ritual to **Contact the Mind of the Observer**.

Amongst descriptions of various interspecies conflicts, you find a description of a strange weapon wielded by the Yith, which features strange nodules and wires on its surface and emits a powerful bolt of blue electricity.
