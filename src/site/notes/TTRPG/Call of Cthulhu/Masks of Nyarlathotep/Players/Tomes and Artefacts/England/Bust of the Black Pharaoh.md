Found in the secret room of Gavigan in the Misr House, this 60cm high bust made of an unknown black material depicts the Black Pharaoh. Staring at the bust for too long invokes feelings of the cold depths of space and something terrible beyond reaching out.

Dick got touched by the Black Pharaoh after staring into the Bust for too long. To get it out of harm's way, the Magician's Guild have spirited away and given a key. The Bust can be found again, if they find the door that can be opened with the key.
