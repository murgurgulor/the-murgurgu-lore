### Dateline: Monday, April 13th, 1925
The group surveys the situation in the cinder cone. Several of the investigators think back to their sci-fi penny dreadfuls and realise the gigantic bullet shaped object might be a "space rocket"! Zasu peers through her Third Eye and discerns that the statue of the Bloated Woman is a chasm in reality, leading into a different dimension. They spend some time discussing tactics but in the end default to their tried and tested 'charge in guns blazing' technique.

Everyone runs in the chamber. Matthias, cradling a bundle of dynamite, makes a run to the statue of the Bloated Woman in an attempt to blow it up. Shark meanwhile runs at the rocket to see if there's any way of disabling it. He learns that it's suspended over a pit of magma with three sturdy struts. Interestingly there are also a dozen pipes running from the bottom straight into the magma, and they're glowing in a white light. The rocket itself is made of a cold and slick metal.

Meanwhile Zasu does what she does best and pulls all attention to her, loudly proclaiming to be sent her by the Bloated Woman to do its bidding. Lawrence and Dick take the opportunity to blast their handgun and elephant rifle respectively to rip one of the Deep Ones apart.

Chaos erupts. Several disheveled humans with a blank stare in their eyes drop the goop they were carrying to the magma pit and charge in the direction of Lawrence and Dick. Deep Ones head to Shark - still on a rickety bridge suspended over a pit of magma! - and Jack to do battle.

At that point, Matthias' dynamite charge detonates and the whole chamber shakes. Some people lose their footing and fall down. Dick gets up and excellently leads the Militia in taking down a Deep One. Shark downs two Deep Ones with his trusty gun.

The dust settles from Matthias'  explosion and it's revealed that the statue of the Bloated Woman is completely unharmed by the dynamite! The ground it stood on not so much, however, and the statue is laying on its side, decaying arms splayed around like a disgusting fan. A pool in the far end of the room bubbles and a horde of Deep Ones emerges from it, including a very big one. Dick momentarily freezes and starts giggling when seeing the monstrous creatures rush towards them. Matthias spots that the human slaves in unison look at the big boy as it arrives, telling him that the big one is the one controlling the slaves!

On the other side of the room, a door slams open and none other than Aubrey Penhew comes striding out, wearing an ornate bronze cuirass and wielding two golden scepters. Remarkably he looks not a day over 50, whereas he should be well in his 80s by now. He starts a monologue in which he reveals that he assumes Jack Brady is responsible for all the party's achievements over the past few months!

Zasu takes the center stage again and loudly proclaims that not Jack Brady, but they are responsible for foiling the cult's plans so far. Lawrence takes the opportunity of confusion to chuck a stick of dynamite at the big Deep One. It hits true, blasting away a large part of the creature. The big boy tries to work a magic spell on Lawrence in return but Lawrence's mind proves to be too keen. Matthias makes an attempt at swordplay to inspire the Militia but to no avail.

Jack is enraged. He starts yelling about all the things Penhew has done to Roger Carlyle and Hypatia Master and hits Penhew with a bullet, but then is confronted with two Deep One Hybrids who try to assault him. Penhew in return works a magic spell on Jack Brady that causes his right arm to shrivel up and wither away! Jack is catatonic in horror, and the other are horrified as well.

Meanwhile, Dick tries to instruct the Militia through his giggles to go for the big Deep One. Through a miracle of psychology they understand and bring the big one down permanently. The human slaves suddenly feels their minds cleared and they run away from the scene. Shark on his turn fires his gun at Penhew who drops to the ground. Curiously he seems to grow older as he lies unconsciously on the floor. Shark, Zasu and Lawrence battle some Deep Ones that are near them, and Matthias charges to Zasu's aid with his sword raised high.

Suddenly, Penhew starts moving again. As he gets up it's noticeable that his wounds are sealing up and that he's starting to look younger again. He tries to work another magic spell on Jack Brady but to no avail. It's at this point that Dick steps in with his elephant gun and blasts Penhew straight in the chest and against the wall. Penhew collapses and ages again.

Shark tries to take the opportunity to restrain Penhew while he's down, but the Deep One harrying him doesn't relent and after a few more hits and bites, Shark loses consciousness! Meanwhile Zasu and Matthias are fighting off a different Deep One and Jack Brady, in a furious rage, punches the Hybrids to death with his left hand and signature Brass Knuckles. 

In the background, the Militia keeps fighting the horde of Deep Ones to great success. They rush them, bring them down with their knives and guns, and even display excellent martial arts as they fling some of them down the pit of magma!

Again, Penhew rises from the grave and rejuvenates. He surveys the room and sees that, to his dismay, things are not going his way. He raises his hands to the toppled statue of the Bloated Woman and entreats his master Nyarlathotep to display its true powers. In the mass of severed and decaying arms, some fingers are starting to twitch...

Penhew tries to make his way to his rooms but with Lawrence and Zasu downing the last of the Deep Ones, he is the only target left. Dick rushes up to Penhew and sets the flame of K'thuga on him. Penhew is minorly burnt but it's noticeable that a chain around his neck starts to glow in a fiery hot glow. Jack and Penhew exchange punches and Matthias cuts at Penhew with his sword as well. Meanwhile Lawrence chucks another stick of dynamite at the twitching arms but his aim is off.

Penhew fires bolts of electricity from his hands to Jack and Dick, but they only minorly damage. He frantically tries to run further into his rooms, but a well-placed hit of Dick with his torch brings Penhew down to the ground again. Dick then wrenches the necklace away. Penhew ages significantly in front of their eyes until all that's left is a frail old dead man. He does not regenerate.

Zasu rushes to Shark's aid, but to no success. The Militia has lost a number of men, but is succeeding in driving the horde of Deep Ones away.

Has the day been won? Or does crooked Aubrey Penhew have one more trick up his sleeve...?
