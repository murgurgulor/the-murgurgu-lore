## Leads pointing to China

- Jackson Elias had a matchbook of the Stumbling Tiger Bar in Shanghai: [[Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/New York Clues#[AM3] Shanghai Matchbook\|[AM3] Shanghai Matchbook]]
- Jackson Elias had a photograph of a boat on a river, which you identified as the Whangpoo River in Shanghai: [[Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/New York Clues#[AM4] Blurry Photograph\|[AM4] Blurry Photograph]]
	- You found the boat, a yacht, which is named the Dark Mistress. It flies a Union Jack and is registered to Alfred Penhurst. According to the harbormaster, it docks every 2-3 weeks to pick up shipments from Ho Fang Imports/Exports, and has its home port listed as a private island in the East China Sea. The captain, Jules Savoyard, looked extremely sickly with a rotting nose, and the sailors reminded Shark of a picture of Deep Ones, an amphibious race that lives in underwater cyclopean cities and worship the Outer God Cthulhu.
- Edward Gavigan had been corresponding with Pale Viper about Jack Brady, who is mentioned being in Shanghai: [[Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/England Clues#[EN5] Letter to Pale Viper\|[EN5] Letter to Pale Viper]]
- Edward Gavigan has been shipping items to Pale Viper, apparently through an agency called Ho Fang Imports/Exports: [[Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/England Clues#[EN4] Ledger Entries\|[EN4] Ledger Entries]]

### Jackson Elias in China

- Reconstructing Jackson’s movements in the last months of his life, you’ve gathered that after leaving Kenya in August 1924, Jackson was in China in September and October 1924 before moving on to Cairo.
- Jackson mentioned a mercenary in Nairobi who claimed to have seen Jack Brady in Shanghai: [[Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Clues/New York Clues#[AM12] Summarized Notes on the Carlyle Expedition\|[AM12] Summarized Notes on the Carlyle Expedition]]
    - _Set Seven is another single sheet. Elias ran into "Nails" Nelson at the Victoria Bar in Nairobi. Nelson had been a mercenary for the Italians on the Somali-Abyssinian border, and had escaped into Kenya hafter double-crossing his employers. Nelson claimed to have seen Jack Brady alive in Hong Kong, less than two years before Elias was in Kenya and long after the Kenyan court declared that Brady and the rest of the expedition were dead. Brady was friendly, though guarded and taciturn. Nelson didn't press the conversation. This report only strengthened Elias' belief that the principle members of the expedition might still live._
