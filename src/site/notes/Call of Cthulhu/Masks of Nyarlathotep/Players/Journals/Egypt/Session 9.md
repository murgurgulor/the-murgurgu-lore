### Dateline: Wednesday, February 25th, 1925
The group has made their way to Suez and found a discrete motel to stay in. When they check out the docks, they unfortunately spot several cultists lurking about, most likely keeping an eye out for them. Two ships are currently docked. Zasu disguises herself as Lawrence’s mother and they head to a skeevy sailor’s bar. They learn that the two ships are headed to South-Africa and Ireland respectively, neither a direction they want to go in. A helpful sailor tells them that the Ivory Wind, a cargo ship headed to Hong Kong, is scheduled to arrive in 4 days time.

While waiting for time to pass, Dick finally learns the Chant of Thoth and to his horror realizes that, opposed to what Matthias has told him, the ritual does not require any disrobing. Dick also starts to read the Song of the Djinn, a tome found in Edward Gavigan’s secret basement and translated from Arabic to English by Matthias’ friend Jimothy.

Meanwhile, Zasu tries to jog Matthias’ memory of their relationship but to no avail. Matthias realizes he is suffering from memory loss, and he figures that since the cause of the memory loss is through supernatural events, a cure must also be found in the supernatural.

### Dateline: Sunday, March 1st, 1925
The Ivory Wind docks in Suez, but cultists are still on the look-out. This time both Zasu and Lawrence get disguised as elderly ladies and make their way to the ship in order to buy passage. Dick and Matthias keep an eye out, and notice that two cultists have seemed to see through the disguise. Dick distracts them by throwing a rock at the head of one of the cultists, who start to run towards Dick and Matthias allowing Lawrence and Zasu to quickly board the ship.

They’re met by Captain Lars Torvik, a large and hairy man, who inquires as to their purpose. They explain they desperately want to visit the Orient. The Captain explains he is a man of strong work ethics and will only allow passengers on his boat who are able to assist in the labour on the boat, and that two old ladies surely cannot pull their weight. Lawrence and Zasu explains that they have manservants who are surely able-bodied enough to carry their weight, and Cpt. Torvik reluctantly agree after Lawrence and Zasu pay him some money to provide for the costs of food supplies and added weight.

Meanwhile the two cultists chase Dick and Matthias through Suez’s alleys, but Dick and Matthias had prepared well and plotted out a course in the days before. Unfortunately Matthias’ stamina fails him and one of the cultists catches up with him. He tries to draw a distracting crowd with money but only produces pennies. The cultist tries to wrestle Matthias to the ground but Matthias manages to escape his clutches. With renewed vigor Matthias starts pumping his legs and quickly leaves the cultist behind him, and even overtakes Dick on the way back to the docks. There they seek refuge in the same sailor’s bar they were in a few days before. They meet Björn, one of the sailors on the Ivory Wind, and in return for free alcohol ask him to deliver a message to Zasu. Björn agrees. Zasu meets the men in the bar and after a night of drinking and friendly clothes swapping, Dick and Matthias sneak up with the rest of the sailors on the Ivory Wind.

Captain Torvik is displeased with the able-bodiedness of the manservants, and inquires what jobs they could perform. Dick offers to cook potatoes. He promises to boil them, mash them, and stick them in a stew. He can also serve as a look-out. Matthias offers to work as the ship’s mental health professional. The group gets accepted on the Ivory Wind and quickly head belowdecks to hide from the cultists. Dick spots some cultists trying to gain access to several ships, but get rebutted by burly sailors. Dick then quickly forges a berth receipt in the name of a different ship, signed by Matthias, and chucks it from a porthole on the docks. The cultists find it and head off on a false trail.

The Ivory Wind sets sail!

### Dateline: Monday, March 2nd to Saturday, March 28th, 1925
The group adapts to boat life quickly. Lawrence is dedicated to keeping his old lady persona - Loretta - up for the entire journey and successfully does so by handing out hard candy on a daily basis. Zasu keeps up her disguise in the beginning as well, but conceives a plan of making Matthias jealous by flirting with the sailors. Unfortunately the sailors aren’t enthused by an old lady, so after a few days Zasu drops her disguise. Captain Torvik is outraged that someone would deceive him and pretend to be an old lady just so they could avoid manual labour on a ship. He complains to Lawrence that he should be ashamed of his daughter. Zasu tries to pay for her berth through song and dance, but performs poorly. She gets assigned to scrubbing the decks. In line with her plan to make Matthias jealous, she proceeds to in a sensual manner. Matthias still doesn’t recall Zasu, but new feelings are definitely stirred. Spurred on by Dick he tries to make a move on her but only manages to make a vague sexual comment that causes Zasu to storm off in anger.

Meanwhile Dick is getting on with learning how to peel and cook potaties, a skill he has never attempted before in his life. The ship’s cook, a short German man named Babi, is forced to teach him but is not pleased about it at all. Babi starts to prank Dick by hiding potato peels in Dick’s clothes and possessions. Matthias on his part is giving the sailors mental health counseling in Freudian style. Inadvertently he ends up convincing Babi that he should have intimate relations with his mother.

Lawrence has a hard time keeping up his disguise as the Captain insists he shares his room, because the crew’s quarters are no place for an old lady. This means Lawrence has to get up before the Captain does to don his diguise, and go to bed after the Captain does to doff it. He’s also running out of hard candy quickly and convinces Dick to make him caramelized potato instead.

One evening Lawrence is out on the deck when Babi visits him, offering a cigarette. Lawrence accepts and takes a few drags, after which the world quickly starts to spin around him. The deck is rippling underneath his feet and the waves are reaching up from the seas to grasp towards him. Babi then tells Lawrence that they need to have a talk about their intentions. To Lawrence’s shock, Babi’s eyes are now yellow with narrow slits as pupils! After, Babi’s form starts to shift and distort, and he slowly turns into a well-dressed [[Call of Cthulhu/Masks of Nyarlathotep/Players/Images/China Images#Ssassathassaa\|Serpentperson]]!

Babi re-introduces himself as Ssassathassaa, one of the last Serpentpeople. He explains to Lawrence that they have been aware of their presence and their dabbling in the occult since England, and their rivalry with several esoteric cults. Ssassathassaa wishes to know if Lawrence and his friends intend to oppose the return of the Great Serpentine Empire as well. Lawrence is confused and asks what that even means. Ssassathassaa then snaps his fingers and suddenly Lawrence is presented with a vision of a lush jungle wilderness with a volcano in the background and pterodactyls flying in the air. Ssassathassaa pulls Lawrence’s attention to a great golden city cradled in the mountains and explains that once, many millennia ago, the Great Serpentine Empire ruled the planet. Then destruction came to the world, as a meteor is suddenly visible in the air, heading towards Earth. Ssassathassaa explain that his people went into hiding underground, but over the time their numbers slowly dwindled and only a few of them remain now. Those remaining have the sole purpose of returning the Great Serpentine Empire to its rightful place in this world. Ssassathassaa explains that they don’t care about the cults and powers the group is currently meddling with, they just want a blood oath from Lawrence that they will not hinder the Serpentfolk when they open the gate to herald their great return.

Lawrence is reluctant and asks for more time to consider, but Ssassathassaa denies him and with the snap of a finger the skies in the vision turn to roiling flames. Lawrence uses the Voorish Sign and notices that this vision flickers in and out with darkness. This tells him that the vision is not real, but he’s also not on the boat anymore. Ssassathassaa chuckles at Lawrence’s magic parlor tricks. Lawrence asks what the Serpentfolk will do with the humans when they return, and Ssassathassaa replies that the humans will be allowed to continue living on the planet, under the rightful rule of the superior Serpent race. Lawrence once again denies the blood oath. Ssassathassaa says that that’s a shame, and that they’ve made an enemy of the Serpentfolk. Then everything fades to black.

Lawrence wakes up the next morning on the foredeck, his clothes in tatters. His friends are relieved to find him, because he was missing all night. Zasu is still a bit drunk from her night of revelry with the sailors. In the night, Dick found some ashes on the deck that gave off a strange magical aura with the Voorish Sign, and he collected the ashes for later analysis.

Lawrence tries to explain that Babi was secretly a Serpentperson, but the others are confused. Who is this Babi? They have never heard of Babi. Lawrence tries to explain that Babi was the ship’s cook but this draws more confused looks: Dick is the ship’s cook, he was hired after the last cook jumped ship in Egypt! It seems that nobody but Lawrence has any recollection of Babi ever existing. Dick thinks back to how he learned to cook potatoes, and realizes he doesn’t have a clear memory on how he learned it. He rationalizes this gap in his memory away by thinking that if you just try it often enough, at one point you’ll eventually learn how to peel and boil a potato.

Lawrence explains the rest of his encounter to the group. Matthias remembers reading a passage in the Pnakotic Manuscripts that spoke of a race of Serpentpeople that reigned supreme millions of years ago. According to the Manuscripts, they were a race capable of amazing engineering and powerful sorcerers.

The group then brings Lawrence to bed for a rest, and when undressing Lawrence finds a cigarette, similar to the one Babi gave him. He decides to keep it separate from the rest of his cigarettes. Dick finds a potato peel in his pockets and wonders where that came from.

---

During the remainder of the trip, Dick reads through the Song of the Djinn and learns how to create an enchanted flame. Lawrence and Zasu overcome their wounds but are left with scars to remember them by. Matthias vaguely tries to reconnect with Zasu but to no avail. She’s had enough of his amnesia and blundering. She takes off her engagement ring and hands it back to Matthias, just as he starts to feel new feelings for her…
