### Dateline: Saturday, May 9th, 1925
The group decides there's nothing much more for them to do in Darwin and start making plans to head to Cuncudgerie by way of Port Hedland. Considering the road conditions they elect to take a boat there. They all have some time to kill, in which Matthias learns survivalling skills from Johnny Bigbush, Zasu practices her gunmanship while Shark and Lawrence practice throwing boomerangs. Dick is spending an unhealthy amount of time diving into the occult. The time passes without troubles, for once. As a bonus, Matthias remembers the location they saw the Serpentperson flee to from an earlier archeological survival training: it is the Mesa Prieta and Cabezon Peak in New Mexico!

### Dateline: Monday, May 11th, 1925
The group docks in Port Hedland, a small terminus town that serves the mining towns further inland by way of rails. They find out there's an airport and promptly charter a plane for 3 days hence. They then visit Robert Mackenzie, friend of Arthur MacWhirr, the man who discovered gigantic monoliths in the desert but succumbed to pneumonia before a proper expedition could be mounted. The group explains that they're looking into this discovery as part of their investigation in the Carlyle Expedition. Robert Mackenzie takes some warming up, but eventually invites the crew in to talk about his late friend Arthur's discoveries. They find out that Robert actually has the coordinates of the find written down somewhere. As Robert goes upstairs to find his journal, Shark mocks Lawrence with a mining hat.

After getting the coordinates and plotting them on the map, pointing to a part of the Great Sandy Desert near the Canning Stock Route, the group manages to convince Robert Mackenzie to arrange for their expedition as well as tag along himself! He is giddy with excitement.

### Dateline: Tuesday, May 12th, 1925
The group and Robert Mackenzie board the freight train to Cuncudgerie. Shark immediately sits next to Zasu and explains his blossoming romantic feelings for her, cultivated over the time they've spent together with guns. Zasu evaluates her current and past situation with Matthias and promptly decides to become Shark's girlfriend. They seal the deal by putting Shark's spare knuckledusters on her hand. Dick and Matthias take no note of this as they discuss plans to locate Matthias' fractured mind in the Dreamlands, implant only that personality - that only knows he loves Zasu and nothing else - in Matthias' body and use that blood for the Ritual of the Eye of Light and Darkness. Lawrence is actively ignoring the rest.

At the end of the afternoon the gang arrives in Cuncudgerie, a bustling yet small mining town. Robert Mackenzie immediately hops off to finalize the expedition's arrangement. Shark tags along to check out the cars. The rest of the gang goes to check on Mortimer Wycroft. They find his shop on the outskirts of town and three young women sitting in front of it, who identify themselves as Mortimer's daughters. Zasu pretends to represent an American bussiness opportunity for Mr. Wycroft and meets the infamous and ghoulish looking Mortimer. He seems guarded and short in his answers. 

While Zasu is distracting Mortimer, Dick takes the opportunity to sneak into the shop. He finds the living arrangements upstairs and he pilfers a book titled 'Wondrous Intelligences' from underneath a dirty bed. It seems the book recounts tales of a merchant who had encounters with Yithians - outer beings of great intelligence and technology that the Pnakotic Manuscripts claim to have brought cognition to humanity!

Meanwhile outside, Zasu slips in some occult references in her speech, which triggers an PTSD-like flashback for Mortimer. His eyes grow distant and he starts raving about the unseen winds in the dark tunnels, that bring death to all those they cross. His daughters come to his aid and bring him inside, but not before Lawrence spies a look of annoyance between the ladies. It appears daddy has shared something that wasn't meant to be shared...

Meanwhile at the truckery, Shark handpicks the best truck for a desert adventure and lovingly names it Ziely. He also checks over the strange device of rods, wheels and mirrors but doesn't discern its workings.

The group reconvenes at the Cuncudgerie Grand, which is proprieted by Mikey Bigbush. They plan to leave on their expedition in the morning!
