Roger Carlyle was a troubled young man. After his parents died he inherited a lot of money and the family company, but he also fell into a deep state of alcoholism and drug abuse. Then Roger met the mysterious M'weru: an African lady who stole his heart. For a while, Roger seemed to be better, until he started to have nightmares about gods and portals. Under pressure of his younger sister Erica, he went into therapy with psychiatrist Robert Huston without much success. Finally, M'weru convinced him to go on an expedition to Egypt.

The Carlyle Expedition consisted of Roger Carlyle, Roger's friend and former lover Hypatia Masters, his psychiatrist Robert Huston and his trusted friend and bodyguard Jack Brady. They first traveled to London, where they met the final member of their team: the renowned Egyptologist Sir Aubrey Penhew. After some planning, they set off to Egypt to start excavations near the Bent Pyramid in Dahshur.

There was a nefarious plan to this expedition, for M'weru, Aubrey Penhew and Robert Huston were under the thrall of Nyarlathotep - an extradimensional entity with an interest in our reality. They abused Roger's wealth and his broken mind to work along, and lure Hypatia into their plans as well. One night, Roger climbed the Red Pyramid and broke one of the seals that kept Nyarlathotep at bay. Everyone sans Jack Brady then disappeared into the Bent Pyramid for a day, and when they reappeared they were rejoiced about having seen the real god.

Their true job done, the Expedition set off for Kenya under the guise of a holiday break. In truth, they were going to meet M'weru. While there, Jack Brady abducted Roger Carlyle and left Kenya. The rest of the Expedition was never seen again. Newspapers reported on them being massacred by tribes, but in reality they faked their own deaths in order to set out their Master's grand plan through the various cults in the world that are dedicated to an aspect of Nyarlathotep - The Bloody Tongue, The Black Pharaoh, The Bloated Woman, The Father of all Bats.

Your good friend Jackson Elias was researching the Carlyle Expedition and discovered this nefarious plot. Unfortunately the cult discovered him as well, and he was murdered before he could tell you the whole story. You brought the perpetrators to justice: Silas M'kwane and Mukunga M'Dari of the New York chapter of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.

In England, you discovered that the new head of the Penhew Foundation - Aubrey Penhew's proteg√© Edward Gavigan - had also stepped up as the leader of Penhew's cult: the Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh. When you discovered his wicked ways, you dispatched him as well as another cult prominent: Zahra Shafik.

In Egypt, you discovered that the Egyptian Brotherhood of the Black Pharaoh - led by Omar al-Shakti - was planning on resurrecting one of Nyarlathotep's most devout servants: the ancient queen Nitocris. You also learned that the Cult of Isis once fought Nyarlathotep in its Black Pharaoh guise. Using the weapons of the Cult, you destroyed Nitocris' body and prevented her resurrection.

In China, you met Jack Brady and heard his side of the story. You battled the Order of the Bloated Woman and their leader, Ho Fang. Then you traveled to Grey Dragon Island where you met Aubrey Penhew. Penhew was constructing an arcane missile that would tear the hole in the universe when the ritual starts. You destroyed both Penhew and the missile, and learned that the ritual is planned for January 16, 1926. You then traveled to Hong Kong to meet the insane Roger Carlyle. He told you that Nyarlathotep impregnated Hypatia Masters to bear him the spawn that will herald the world's end, and that she's currently with M'weru in the Mountain of the Black Wind in Kenya.

In Australia, you're looking for Robert Huston who is digging up alien technologies in the Great City of Pnakotus, former base of the Yith, using the Cult of the Sand Bat to aid him.
