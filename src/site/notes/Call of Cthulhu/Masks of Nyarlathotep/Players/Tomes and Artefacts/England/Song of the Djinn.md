##### Initial Reading
Alleged to be the transcript of a discussion between al-Sabbah and a “scorching fire.” The conversations touch on a wide variety of esoteric and arcane subject matter; however, much of the material appears to be extracted from myths, legends, and literature. The text ends with a description of the methods al-Sabbah used to create a vessel that may be used to house his “flaming djinni.”

The tome provides a spell to construct a brazier or torch that allows the user to create an “enchanted flame” as well as bind any summoned “efreet”.

“The cold desert night erupted in flames. The once dark, forbidding heavens exploded with blinding light. From behind, my djinni companion warned me not to look away, as the Burning One would not bear my disrespect lightly. My eyes burned for uncountable agonizing minutes, as the infernal orb slowly cooled to a dull orange glow blotched with ugly, shifting dark spots on its surface. Tongues of brighter flame licked along the surface of the giant blazing mass that hung in the sky, blotting out the moon and dimming the stars. I thought I saw the outline of strange and wicked chains resisting the violent rotation of this great conflagration. Despite the fading intensity of the globe’s light, a scorching pain continued to build in my skull accompanied by a deafening roar raging through the atmosphere above. Without warning, the vengeful conflagration plummeted to the earth engulfing the ancient pyramid in flames and searing the vision of K’tugah forever into my mind.”

“My companion led me to the expanse of a great plateau high above the desert. We had traveled deep into the night from the nearby village. He directed my gaze skyward to a faint blue light traversing the void above, as he engulfed me in his fire."

“Suddenly I stood before a giant temple, seemingly constructed from great sheets of ice and lit by a chilling orb of guttering blue flame. I felt the immensity of this power as the cold cosmos ripped by with celestial bodies vanishing in fading trails. Despite the chill emitting from the orb, the strange frozen ground below me emitted a disturbing warmth."

“I was ordered to bow before the King Regent and High Priest, Fatwah-gah. And so I did.”

(…)

“For my acquiescence and by the mercy of my new King, I believe I was permitted to live. During my brief stay on K’tin’ja, I learned that my companion and guide was but one of many. During my short time at the King Regent’s court, I watched many more such beings manifest escorting a bewildering variety of other humans and strange creatures. These fellow travelers disappeared in agony, consumed by the living fires. I watched, rapt, as Fatwah-gah’s subjects made their offerings, dissolving souls and harvesting knowledge. In awe, I offered my soul to my companion, yet he declined. ‘Your day has not yet arrived, al-Sabbah, but it shall.”
