A small metal cube of 20 cm on each side, covered in miniscule tubes and holes. One attuned to the Mist Maker can expend **1 Sanity** and a **variable number of Magic Points** to command the apparatus to spew forth a thick cloud of mist. 

The dense mist covers a spherical area with a diameter of **2 meters per Magic Point spent**. Anyone in the fog can't see further than 30 cm in front of them. Anyone breathing the magical mists for a prolonged time might start suffering from visual hallucinations of gigantic underwater cities drawing ever closer, and feel as if they could just step into the cavernous metropoles and disappear in cyclopean nightmares forever.

If the mist is expelled in open air it disperses in a few minutes, faster if there's a hard wind. Indoors it can linger for up to half an hour.
