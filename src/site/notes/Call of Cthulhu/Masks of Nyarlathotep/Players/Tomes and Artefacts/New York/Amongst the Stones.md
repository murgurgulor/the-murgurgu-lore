##### Initial Reading
 A collection of poetry, mostly in modern style without structure, focuses on dark themes with occasionally oddly juxtaposed romantic elements. Titles include “Out of the Old Land”, ”People of the Monolith”, and “My Ancient Queen”. 
 For contemporary sensibilities, the content will seem sensational and disquieting despite the author’s apparent lyrical gifts.

##### Full Study or Focused Reading
_They say foul things of Old Times still lurk_
_In dark forgotten corners of the world._
_And Gates still gape to loose, on certain nights._
_Shapes pent in Hell._
_–**People of the Monolith**_

_They lumber through the night_
_With their elephantine tread;_
_I shudder in affright_
_As I cower in my bed._
_They lift colossal wings_
_On the high gable roofs_
_Which tremble to the trample_
_Of their mastodonic hoofs_
_–**Out of the Old Land**_

_In her jet black crown_
_she shall will the weak to bow down._
_Wearing starred ruby at her supple waist_
_mortal lives shall be erased._
_With silver and emeralds upon her chest_
_the Queen will be immortally blessed_
_Forever, I shall tend her dark desire_
_offering my flesh to her Ebon pyre_
_For vengeance, once more she returns_
-_**My Ancient Queen**_
