A strange mask was found in the Ju-Ju House. It consists of a cage made of a wood unknown to the investigators with covers the head of the wearer. Perched on top of the cage are stylised carvings of four figures, reminiscent of masks worn by the Yoruba tribes to channel their gods.

- An old bearded man who is recognised at **Nodens**, who is known as the Lord of the Great Abyss and Father of Nightgaunts;
- A glob of eyes that is recognised as **Yog-Sothoth**, who is known as The Key and The Gate, and the Opener of the Way. He is known to see all of space-time and knows the secret to the universeâ€™s terrible end;
- A mass of tendrils which is recognised as **Azathoth**, who is known as the Demon Sultan and the Sleeping Chaos. A mindless entity who babbles profane blasphemies in his court surrounded by mad pipers and dancers, and who will one day consume all;
- A misshaped goat who is recognised as **Shub-Nigurath**, who is known as The Black Goat of The Woods with a Thousand Young and The All-Mother. This entity brings with it rot, decay and destruction, and its young spread across the land bringing disease and misery.
