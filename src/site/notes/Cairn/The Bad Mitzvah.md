It's been a month since your adventure at Weatherstone. After gathering your rewards from Ulrek, you parted ways to pursue other personal goals. Now you have reunited for the momentous - and unique - occassion of Bobby's second Bar Mitzvah!

You've all gathered in Bobby's hometown of Tannic, a small village on the edge of a lush lake and thick forest. The celebrations are extensive: a large swath of land has been hired out to host family, friends, well-wishers, and distant relations. In a festival-esque surrounding you find merry bards making songs, fearless acrobatics putting on daring performances, and one singular creepy clown that no one seems to remember booking.

The party is well on its way into the afternoon, when you suddenly hear a commotion. Some distant screaming, coming closer. Someone crashes over a barrel of Kugel Fizz and stumbles into the clearing. It's Scoutmaster Justin of the Tannic Scouting Troupe! His hair is disheveled, his tunic is torn, scratches all over his skin. Wide-eyed, he looks around at no one in particular. As the dubious clown starts to comfort him, Scoutmaster Justin finds his words again.

"The children!" He gasps. "The children are gone!"
