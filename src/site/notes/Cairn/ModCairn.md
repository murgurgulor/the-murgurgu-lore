# What's on the Character Sheet

### Qualities
Everyone has three Qualities: **Vigour** (VIG), **Clarity** (CLA), and **Spirit** (SPI).
- **Vigour** encompasses your physical strength, fortitude, and stamina. If you take physical damage, it lowers your Vigour.
- **Clarity** encompasses your agility, quick-thinking, and keen instincts. If you are met with disorienting circumstances or mind-muddling situations, it lowers your Clarity.
- **Spirit** encompasses your willpower, hope, and heart. If you are demoralized, intimidated, or otherwise disheartened, it lowers your Spirit.

Each Quality is ranked between 3 and 18, and you determine your starting score by rolling 3d6.

Whenever you perform a risky action, you roll a **Save** with the appropriate Quality. Your Qualities can also decrease during play, lowering your chance of successful Saves and thereby increasing the risks you take with your actions. 

When an Quality reaches 0, you are either dead (VIG), unable to react to the world around you (CLA), or utterly hopeless (SPI).


### Background
Your character has a Background: a description of the experiences, knowledge, and skills you have obtained in your life so far. A large number of quirky Backgrounds can be found here: https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/backgrounds/. If you want a more low-key fantasy background, you can also peruse these lists: https://cairnrpg.com/barebones/barebones-gear-packages/, https://cairnrpg.com/barebones/barebones-character-creation/#background
You can choose or roll for one of these Backgrounds, or make a custom one that adheres to the same format and style.

Each Background gives you:
- Starting gear
- Funky and unique items and personal history
- Diegetic knowledge and skills: a character who is a *Greenwise* (druid-type background) would have a lot of knowledge about plants, nature, and how to navigate through thickets. A *Cutpurse* on the other hand might be more skilled in climbing, sneaking, and may have lots of connections. 


### Guard
**Guard** (GD) represents your ability and capacity to avoid actual harm. When you are attacked and you are in a position where you could defend yourself to avoid harm, damage gets taken off your Guard before it lowers the appropriate Quality. 

If an attack fails to reduce your Guard to 0, you've not taken any actual wounds: you've managed to protect yourself against it.

You determine your max GD by rolling 1d6. GD is recovered quickly: just taking a moment to catch your breath after a fight restores it back to full. 

During play, your max GD can increase if you suffer a **Scar** in combat.


### Inventory
Your Inventory is a key aspect of the game. The items you carry define the actions you can take. Everyone has 10 Inventory Slots. 
- 1 Slot for each Hand
- 2 Slots on your Body
- 6 Slots in your Pack

Items in *At Hand* or *Body* slots are readily available for use, items in your *Pack* require time to recover in stressful situations.

You can carry a reasonable number of items beyond your Inventory Slots, but you become **Exposed** if you do so. You can also increase your carrying capacity by getting a cart or pack animal.

Items come in 3 varieties:
- **Normal** items occupy 1 slot. Some items have a restricted amount of uses before they're spent, for example a Torch can be lit 3 times before it expires.
- **Bulky** items occupy 2 slots
- **Petty** items occupy no slots, but a bunch of them can be bundled to occupy 1 slot. For example: 3 uses of Rations occupies one slot.

Whether an item is considered Normal, Bulky, or Petty is determined by both its physical size, as well as its importance in use. A Small Bomb might be considered a Normal item, even though it'd be the same size as a Nice Rock which would be considered Petty.

*Examples of item cards with multiple uses.*

### Conditions
There are four Conditions that influence your character's capacities: **Exposed**, **Fatigued**, **Deprived**, and **Strain**.

##### Exposed 
You are **Exposed** if you are encumbered (carrying more items than you have slots for) or otherwise unable to actively defend yourself. While you are Exposed, your Guard is treated as 0 and you can't recover it when resting.

##### Fatigued
In combat, you can perform special maneuvers called Feats that can demand a lot of your energy. If you are **Fatigued**, you've overtaxed yourself and can't perform any more Feats. You lose Fatigue after a short rest.

##### Deprived
You're **Deprived** if you haven't had sufficient food, drink, or rest for 24 hours. When you're Deprived, you can't recover your Guard in a short rest, nor can you recover any Quality Loss. 

Furthermore: if you are Deprived for more than 24 hours, you take one instance of **Strain** for every day you're Deprived. 

As soon as you cure the source of your deprivation, you lose the condition.

##### Strain
**Strain** is a condition that represents exhaustion, overexertion, and stress. It occupies 1 Inventory Slot, and until the Strain clears you can't use that slot for carrying items. If you have to take Strain when you're already at full Inventory, you either become **Exposed**, or you have to drop an item.

Strain can be gained from strenuous activites, not sleeping or resting enough, or overtaxing your body. Strain can accumulate, occupying one slot for each instance of Strain you have. 

You remove all Strain after you've had a full night's rest. If your night's rest was interrupted with light activity like keeping watch, you remove only one instance of Strain. 
You don't remove any Strain if your night was rudely interrupted by cumbersome activities like fighting or fleeing.

### Armor
Armor represents physical gear that blocks damage from incoming attacks. When you get attacked with a physical attack, you deduct your Armor value from the damage before applying it to your GD.

Armor from Shields only functions if the Shield is worn in an *At Hand* slot.
Armor from body pieces only functions if it is worn on a *Body* slot.


### Wealth
Your Wealth is expressed in coins: Copper Shavings, Silver Guilders, and Golden Marks.
Coins are not counted towards your inventory, but treasures in other shapes - jewels, gems, and such - can be required to occupy a slot. When you get back into town and sell them for money, you add it to your Wealth.

# The Rules of the Game
The rules of the game are straightforward. The GM describes the environment and your situation, and the player characters react to it. Characters can do anything they can be reasonably assumed to be capable of, keeping in mind their background and prior achievements.  

The aim is to always have the game moving forward, to avoid lulls in the action, and to have the players make interesting choices. To this end, there are no rolls to see if you can do something that you should be reasonably able to do considering the circumstances. Rolling (and potentially failing) brings an unnecessary interruption to the flow, and doesn't provide any interesting choices. 


### Taking Action
When judging whether you can do something, consider if you have **Time**, **Gear**, and **Skill**.
- You have **Time** if there is nothing in your current situation that prevents you from taking as long as you need.
- You have **Gear** if you have items or the correct circumstances required to perform your task. Having a rope for climbing a wall counts as correct Gear, but the wall itself being rough and climable can also count as correct Gear.
- You have **Skill** if your character would be the kind of person who would be able to do the thing that you want to do. A thief has the skill to pick locks, a soldier doesn't.

After checking these factors:
- If you have zero or one, you probably can't do it
- If you have all three, you can probably do it
- If you have two, you can probably do it but you might need to roll a Save to avoid a negative outcome


### Knowing and Seeing
Additionally, there are no Knowledge- or Perception-type rolls. The GM gives any information a character would likely know/see with regards to their Background or current situation. Neither are there Persuasion-type rolls: you interact with an NPC as you would with a normal person, and they react according to their personality/motivations/beliefs. 


### Saves
The main roll in the game is the **Save**. You don't make a Save to see if you can do something, you make a Save **to avoid risk or harm from a potentially dangerous action**. If you take an action that doesn't have any risk involved, you don't need to roll a Save - you can just do it. 

Saves are made with one of the three Qualities: VIG, CLA, or SPI. If you have to roll a Save, you roll a d20 and compare the result to the relevant Quality. If the result is **equal to or lower** than your Quality, you succeed in avoiding risk or harm. If it's **greater** than your Quality, you are subjected to risk or harm.

If two sides are in a contest, the individual that is **most at risk as a result of failure** has to make the Save.

There is no Advantage or Disadvantage. Planning your moves carefully and executing cunning schemes to improve your situation influences your position when you make a daring move. If your plans have put you in a good position, the impact of consequences from a failed Save is reduced. If you play it right, you might even negate any risk from your actions and avoid a Save altogether.
Conversely: if you don't anticipate for any risks or dangers and just blindly rush into a dangerous situation, you are put in a bad position where a successful Save can only achieve damage control, but not negate any negative outcomes.

# Combat
Combat is fast and dangerous. Any good hit could wound you, and death is lurking around every corner. Choose your fights carefully!

Combat is split up in rounds of roughly 10 seconds. Each round, every group of participants takes their actions at the same time. After every group ('side') has had their turn, a new round starts.


### Distance and Range
Everyone's distance to each other in combat is expressed in relative terms.
- **Engaged**: At arm's length. You need to be *Engaged* with an opponent in order to make a Melee Attack against them. You can't make a Ranged Attack if you start your turn *Engaged* with an enemy.
- **Nearby**: Within movement's distance; within 40 feet; '*Across the room*.' You can make a Melee Attack against a *Nearby* target if your weapon has *Reach*, or you can make a Ranged Attack.
- **Far**: Further away; between 40-160 feet; '*Across the field*.' You can't make Melee Attacks, but Ranged Attacks function normally.
- **Distant**: Quite far away, hard to make out details; More than 160 feet away. Ranged Attacks against *Distant* targets are *Impaired*.

If you move during your turn, you can shift your relative distance up or down one category (moving towards a *Nearby* monster to *Engage* it, fleeing to get *Distant* from a *Far* archer). 
Using your turn's action for extra movement allows you to shift an additional step, within reason.


### Turn Order
Combat rounds are around 10 seconds long, and every character on the same side of the fight takes their actions simultaneously. When it's your side's turn, everyone needs to declare what their character is going to do **before** any dice are rolled. You're free to talk tactics and discuss schemes. After everyone has declared their actions, the results get resolved and all the dice get rolled at the same time.

In a round, the player characters have their turn before the opposing side(s).

If one of the sides is surprised by the other before combat, they don't get to have their turn in the first round.
If neither side is surprised, each player character needs to pass a CLA Save in order to act in the **first** round of combat.


### Your Turn
When your side has its turn, you can declare to Move and an Action. If you Move, you move either **before** or **after** your Action, you can't split it up around your action.

Switching one *At Hand* and *Body* item around doesn't count as an action and can be done freely at any point during your turn.

If you Move, you can shift your relative distance to others by one step. In terms of absolute distance, a Move allows you to move around 40 feet.

Actions include:
- Making an attack and/or performing a Gambit
- Aid an ally in their action
- Use an *At Hand* or *Body* item
- Switching both *At Hand* and both *Body* items around, switching an *At Hand/Body* item with a *Pack* item, or giving an item to an ally
- Moving further than you would normally be able to
- Flee
- Parley
- Anything else that would reasonably fit in this list


### Attacking
There are no separate to-hit rolls. When you attack, you roll the attack dice of your weapons. The result of these dice compared to the Armor and GD of the target determine the effect of your attack. 

If your attack didn't deplete your enemy's Guard, you didn't wound your enemy. If your attack exceeds your enemy's Guard, any excess damage reduces their Vigour and you've wounded them.

Attack dice range from *d4* for unarmed or *Impaired* attacks to *d10* for big two-handed weapons.

##### Melee Attacks
You can make a melee attack against an opponent if you are *Engaged* with them, or if they are *Nearby* and your weapon has the *Reach* property. You can dual wield two Light weapons, or one Balanced weapon and a Light weapon, rolling both attack dice if you do so.

##### Ranged Attacks
You can make ranged attacks against opponents that are *Nearby* or *Far* without a problem. A ranged attack against a *Distant* opponent is *Impaired*. You can't make a Ranged Attack if you start your turn *Engaged* with an opponent, even if you move away from them first. 

Ranged weapons that use ammunition come with an appropriate quiver (included in the item slot). Ammunition is not tracked minutely. Instead, each of these weapons has 3 usage dots. After combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1-3, you mark one of the dots. When all three dots are marked, you're out of ammo. This represents the combined variables of how many arrows you shoot and how many functional arrows you can retrieve after a fight. If you are unable to retrieve arrows after a fight - when fleeing for example - you always mark a usage dot.

You can stock up on more ammo by buying additional Quivers. Each additional Quiver occupies an item slot and has 3 usage dots. An extra Quiver needs to be on a *Body* slot in order to be used.

---

##### Multiple Attack Dice
If you attack an opponent with more than one weapon, or if more than one character attacks the same opponent in the same round, everyone rolls all applicable attack dice for their attack. After rolling, characters may expend any dice of 4 or higher to perform a Gambit (see below). Afterwards, only the single highest remaining value is applied as damage.

**Example**
	*Yan is wielding two daggers. Each dagger has a d6 attack die. When Yan attacks an enemy with both his daggers, he rolls a d6 twice and applies the highest of the two as damage.*
	-
	*Yokel is wielding a longsword and a shield. The longsword has a d8 attack die, the shield a d4. When Yokel attacks an enemy with his sword and a shield bash, he rolls 1d8 and 1d4 and applies the highest number rolled as damage.*


##### Attack Modifiers
There are several modifiers that affect your attacks:
- **Impaired**: If you make an attack from a position of weakness or disadvantage, your attack is *Impaired*. When your attack is *Impaired*, you roll only a **single d4** for this attack, regardless of the weapons you use. Ranged Attacks made against *Distant* enemies are always *Impaired*, and attacks made with *Reach* weapons in confined spaces may also be *Impaired*.
- **Enhanced**: If a particular circumstance works in your benefit, you can get a bonus attack die on your attack. Usually this is *+d8*, which means you roll a d8 in addition to your normal attack dice and - as usual - keep the single highest value. You can also use the result of this bonus die for a Gambit. Depending on the circumstances, you might get to roll a bigger die for bonus damage. The **Frenzy** Feat can give you a *+d12* bonus die, for example.
- **Blast**: A Blast attack affects multiple targets close together, not discriminating between friend and foe. Roll the attack dice for each target separately. 


---
### Gambits
Gambits are maneuvers you can make to apply a **temporary effect** on your target. You choose to perform a Gambit after you've rolled your attack dice, but before damage is applied. You can only perform a Gambit with a Melee Attack.

You can perform a Gambit by expending any attack die of **4 or higher** from your roll. When you expend the die, you take it off the table and it is no longer considered when determining the single highest value for damage. 
If the die you expended for the Gambit was **8 or higher**, your target either doesn't get a chance to resist the effect, or you can ask for a greater or longer lasting effect from the GM.

When you decide to perform a Gambit, the target of the Gambit must be the target of the attack. 

Targets get to make a **VIG Save** to avoid the effect of a Gambit - with the exception of the *Bolster* and *Move* Gambit. If you expend an 8+ die for the Gambit, you can deny the target their Save.

If multiple characters perform a Gambit against the same target at the same time, they can't perform the same Gambit - again with the exception of *Bolster* and *Move*. 

If one character performs multiple Gambits that grant a Save, the opponent only gets to roll one VIG Save for an all-or-nothing result.

Gambits can never do something that would outright end combat, they only give a temporary advantage.

The Gambits are:
- **Bolster**: Add +1 to the attack's total damage (stacks).
- **Move**: Move after your attack, even if you have already moved or are unable to move.
- **Repel**: Force an opponent away from you. 
- **Stop**: Prevent an opponent from moving on their next turn.
- **Impair**: Impair a weapon, or otherwise weaken one attacking power of an opponent on their next turn.
- **Expose**: Negate the opponent's sources of Armor for the round, or otherwise weaken one defensive aspect of the opponent.
- **Dismount**: Dismount a mounted opponent.
- **Something else** that would reasonably fit in the above list. State what your intended effect is and check whether it doesn't match the effect of one of the other Gambits. If not, the GM will tell you what the effect of your Gambit will be and you can make an informed decision.

**Example**
	*Characters Yan and Yokel both declare to attack the same creature. Yan is wielding two daggers, Yokel a longsword and shield. When their action resolves, Yan rolls a d6 twice and Yokel rolls a d8 and a d4. They come up with 2, 4, 5, 4 respectively.* 
	*Yan and Yokel decide to expend both 4's to perform two Gambits. Yan will Bolster to increase the attack's damage, and Yokel will Repel the creature away - for which the creature gets a VIG Save to avoid the effect.*
	*After Yan and Yokel expend their Gambit dice, only the 2 and 5 remain. The 5 gets applied as damage to the creature, +1 from Yan's Bolster for a total of 6 damage.* 
	*Yan couldn't have chosen to also Repel the creature, but Yokel could have chosen to also Bolster the attack. In that case they would have dealt 7 damage.*


---
### Feats
Every character can perform the following 3 Feats in combat. A Feat is a special maneuver that you make on your attack or as a response to someone else's attack. You can only apply one Feat per character per attack. 

After you perform a Feat, roll the associated Save. If you fail this Save, you are **Fatigued**: you can't perform any more Feats until you've had a rest.

The Feats are:
- **Frenzy** (*VIG Save*): You declare to Frenzy *when you declare your attack, before the attack dice have been rolled*. When you Frenzy, choose one effect on your attack:
	- You get *+d12* bonus damage
	- Your attack gains the *Blast* property
	- You leave a specific physical mark on your enemy, if this attack Wounds your opponent 
- **Focus** (*CLA Save*): You declare to Focus *after you've rolled your attack dice, but before damage is applied*. When you Focus, you can perform a Gambit against your opponent without expending an attack die. 
- **Fend** (*SPI Save*): You declare to Fend *when you or an ally at arm's length are hit with an attack*. When you Fend, you can choose to discard one of the attacker's attack dice. 


---
## Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single unit: the *Detachment*. 
- Attacks by individuals against Detachments are always *Impaired*, unless it's *Blast* damage or other attacks that provide a suitably large area of effect.
- Attacks of Detachments against individuals gain *+d12* and *Blast*.
- A Detachment doesn't make a VIG Save for Critical Damage. Instead, when its VIG is reduced to half or lower, it must make a **SPI Save** or be routed and flee. If the Detachment has a specific leader, the leader's SPI is used.
- When a Detachment's VIG is reduced to 0, it is wiped out.


---
# Getting Hurt
When enemies attack you, follow this procedure:
- Consider the attack dice rolled by the opponents: the GM will tell you if it expends any dice for Gambits, and what the damage will be.
- Choose whether you (or one of your ally's) wants to **Fend**.
- Deduct your Armor value from the single highest value die remaining.
- Apply the remaining damage to your Guard. 
	- If you have at least 1 GD remaining, you have evaded the attack.
	- If this brings your GD exactly to 0, you take a **Scar**.
	- If this exceeds your GD, any excess damage is applied to your Vigour
- If you take damage to your Vigour, immediately make a VIG Save using your new score. 
	- If you succeed you are **Wounded** but still in the game.
	- If you fail, you are **Critically Wounded** - you're down and dying, only able to crawl and moan weakly. If untended to, you die within the hour. Some opponents have a special ability or effect that triggers when they Critically Wound you.
	- After combat, an ally with Bandages can patch you up and bring you from Critically Wounded to Wounded. This does not recover any Vigour.
- If damage reduces your Vigour to 0, you die. 

Note that GD only protects you from damage that you could *reasonably prevent*. Damage from other sources, such as falling from a great height or ingesting poison, are treated as if you are **Exposed** and is applied directly to your Vigour. However, this kind of damage does not necessarily trigger a VIG Save to avoid being Critically Wounded.


### Scars
When an attack in combat reduces your GD to exactly 0, you take a Scar. The amount of GD you lost in the attack that gave you the Scar determines the effect. Consult the table below.

| GD Lost | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 3 GD    | **Walloped**: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are **Deprived** until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max GD.                                                                                                                                            |
| 4 GD    | **Broken Limb**: Roll 1d6 to determine the bone - 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended,roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                                                                          |
| 5 GD    | **Disease**: Your wound gets afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                                                                          |
| 6 GD    | **Reorienting Head Wound**: Roll 1d6 \| 1-2: VIG, 3-4: CLA, 5-6: SPI. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current Quality, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7 GD    | **Hamstrung**: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max CLA, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 8 GD    | **Deafened**: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a SPI save. If you pass, increase your max SPI by 1d4.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9 GD    | **Re-brained**: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max SPI, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10 GD   | **Sundered**: An appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless (the GM will tell you which.) Then make a SPI save. If you pass, increase your max SPI by 1d6.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11 GD   | **Mortal Wound**: You are **Deprived** and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max GD.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12 GD   | **Doomed**: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. You are out of action until you've had a day to recover. Afterwards, your next VIG Save from a Wound determines your fate. If it is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result. |

### Recovering
If you can take a moment to catch your breath after a fight, your GD recovers fully unless you're **Deprived** or **Exposed**.
If you rest in a safe environment for at least 10 minutes and you are not **Deprived**, you recover from **Fatigue**.

Quality Loss is recovered at one point per full night's rest. If multiple Qualities are reduced, choose which one to recover a point in each day.

All Quality Loss is fully recovered after a full week's dedicated rest.

# The Armory

### Melee Weapons
Melee Weapons are divided in three categories:

**Light Weapons** (*d6*) 
- Light Weapons are small weapons that can easily be dual wielded, or that can be concealed on your body. 
- Light Weapons have a d6 as their attack die.
- Examples of Light Weapons are daggers, clubs, handaxes, brass knuckles, etc.

**Balanced Weapons** (*d8*)
- Balanced Weapons are weapons of some size that require precision and balance to effectively wield. 
- Balanced weapons can be combined with a Shield or a Light Weapon, but not with another Balanced Weapon. 
- You can't easily conceal Balanced weapons on your body. 
- Balanced Weapons have a d8 as their attack die.
- Examples of Balanced Weapons are longsword, spears, maces, battleaxes, etc.

**Great Weapons** (*d10*)
- Great Weapons are weapons that require both hands to wield.
- Great Weapons have a d10 as their attack die. 
- They are *Bulky* and have *Reach*, but attacks with Great Weapons in confined spaces are *Impaired*.
- Examples of Great Weapons are greatswords, glaives, halberds, longspears, etc.

**Special**
If you wield a Shield, you can use it as a weapon to **Shield Bash**. A Shield Bash has a d4 attack die. If you Shield Bash, you can't use your Shield for Armor for the remainder of the round.


### Ranged Weapons
Ranged Weapons can't be used if you **start** your turn *Engaged* with an opponent.
Ranged Weapons can target anyone you can reasonably see, but attacks against *Distant* targets are *Impaired*.
Each Ranged Weapon has 3 usage dots of ammunition in its item slot. More ammunition can be bought and occupies a separate slot.

**One-handed Ranged Weapons**
- Sling: d4 attack die, considered a Light Weapon for purposes of dual wielding.
- Javelin: d6 attack die, considered a Balanced Weapon for purposes of dual wielding.

**Two-handed (*Bulky*) Ranged Weapons**
- Shortbow: d6 attack die.
- Longbow: d8 attack die. *Impaired* in cramped spaces.
- Crossbow: d10 attack die, and has to be reloaded after each attack. You can reload a crossbow by forgoing your movement or using an action.


### Armor
- **Shield**: +1 Armor, must be worn in an *At Hand* slot
	- Can be used to **Shield Bash** for d4, but you lose the Armor value until your next turn.
- **Light Armor** (Gambeson, Chain Shirt): +1 Armor, must be worn in a *Body* slot
- **Heavy Armor** (Chain Mail, Breastplate): +2 Armor, *Bulky*, must be worn in both *Body* slots
- **Plate Mail**: +3 Armor, *Bulky*, must be worn in both *Body* slots. Difficult to move around in and can make athletic actions more difficult or risky.

# Magic
### Runeskelfs
Magic is contained in **Runeskelfs**. Runeskelfs are shards of bark broken from a tree that is deeply rooted in subterranean magic. Runeskelfs contain part of that magic, and act as a conduit between the wielder's intent and the physical reality. Each Runeskelf is inscribed with two runes of the Ur-language. These Runes are difficult to directly translate and can have many different meanings based on the circumstances and intent.

When you wield a Runeskelf, you focus your energy on visualizing an intended effect on the physical world that could be described with the Ur-Runes on the stone. Usually the Ur-Runes provide many different kinds of interpretations. The GM will tell you to what extent your effect is achievable.

**Example**
	*If you wield a Runeskelf with the runes 'Expanding Mind', one application could be to temporarily enhance someone's cognitive capacities in order to solve a difficult problem. A different application could be to enlarge an opponent's brain in their skull to hurt them. A third application could be to establish some form of telepathy between several people and create a temporary hivemind.*

![Pasted image 20251112090636.png](/img/user/z_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020251112090636.png)

### Channeling Runeskelfs
Channeling your energy through a Runeskelf requires freedom of body and mind. You can only use a Runeskelf if you have **at least one empty Inventory Slot**. After you've used the Runeskelf, roll a d6. On a 1-3, you take one **Strain** from the mental efforts.

If you try to channel a Runeskelf in a particularly tense or dangerous situation, there's a chance of the magic backfiring on you. The GM can require you to make a SPI Save, and on a failed save there will be an unforeseen and unfortunate side-effect to your magic in addition to the intended effect.


### Magical Effects
The effects of magic are broad and difficult to define. In general, keep in mind the following types of effects you can achieve with magic:
- Create a unique circumstance to fix an issue or solve a problem
- Bypass a situation that could normally require you to make a Save
- Bypass a situation that could normally require you to have a specific skill or resource
- Hinder or aid actions of others
- Deal damage (*d8*, or *d6 Blast*) to targets that are *Engaged* or *Nearby*
	- Or: deal direct Quality Loss (*d4*) if the target fails a Save


### Extra Effort
If you want to achieve an effect that's greater than listed above - such as affecting more than one target, covering a larger area or range, enhancing the overall effect, or any combination thereof - you will have to put in extra **Effort**. 

Putting in **Effort** requires you to have an additional empty Inventory Slot available per Effort expended. You can expend Effort up to a maximum of three times per casting (requiring a total of 4 empty Inventory Slots to do so: one of the base casting, and one for each extra Effort). However, you can share the Effort with one other person, providing they are willing, have empty Inventory Slots, and they hold your hand. Sharing Effort can be risky, because unexpected side-effects can occur if the intentions of the two persons do not align properly. The aiding person always needs to pass a SPI Save in order to avoid any consequences from misaligned intentions.

After you cast the spell, roll a d6 for each Effort you put in. For each die that comes up as a 1-3 you take an additional instance of **Strain**. Additionally, if one or more of the dice comes up as a 1, the Runeskelf is tapped out and can't be used again until it is recharged. Each Runeskelf has a specific recharge ritual related to the Runes it holds.


### Random Runeskelfs
If you happen to find a random Runeskelf, the Ur-Runes inscribed are randomly determined according to the spell generation methods of the TTRPG *Maze Rats*:

# Optional Reading

## Dungeon Crawling
When the characters explore a dungeon or a dungeon-like environment, they follow a cyclical process: the **Dungeon Cycle**. Each Dungeon Cycle, the characters can choose to move, explore, search, or rest in the dungeon, with the following sequence of play:

1. The GM describes the current environment and rehashes the party's situation, giving any pertinent information that is immediately noticeable to the characters.
2. The players each declare what activity their characters will be doing during the Cycle. Examples of common activities are:
	- Moving through a long passage or hall
	- Searching a room for secrets (particularly large rooms may require you to state a specific area to search)
	- Traversing a series of previously explored rooms
	- Keep an eye out for danger
	- Overcome an obstacle, such as a locked door or a trap
	- Fight monsters or bad guys
3. Once everyone has declared their activity, all activities resolve simultaneously.
4. The GM determines whether there is a trigger to roll the **Dungeon Event Die** on this Cycle, and resolves the outcome.
5. Any resources are checked against their duration and inventory is updated, and the Cycle repeats.

A Dungeon Cycle takes an unspecified amount of time, but for purposes of time-keeping one Cycle is considered to last for 10 minutes.


### The Dungeon Event Die
When the characters move through the Dungeon, they might attract unwanted attention or cause the dungeon to change in some way. The **Dungeon Event Die** is a tool for the GM to determine when and how these dynamics change.

The GM rolls the Dungeon Event Die when the party draws attention to themselves, such as:
- They travel to a new level or zone of the dungeon
- They traverse a sequence of previously explored locations
- They linger for longer than a Cycle in an unsafe location
- They rest in an unsafe location
- They make a disturbance or otherwise cause a ruckus

The Dungeon Event Die starting size is dependent on the status of the dungeon, see below. Usually it is a *d12* or *d10*. If the party's actions creates unusual unrest or disturbances in the dungeon, the die steps down in size (so from *d12* to *d10*, or from *d8* to *d6*) to a minimum of *d6*. The die may also step down when the party enters an area in the dungeon with more activity than others, and vice versa. When the Event Die is a *d6*. it might be a good idea for the party to leave and come back when things have cooled down - if they can.
Laying low in a safe location for a few Cycles can result in the Event Die stepping up again, to a maximum of *d12*.

On a result of 1-6 on the Dungeon Event Die, something happens in response to the party's presence. A result of 7 or higher means the party is safe, for now.


| Dungeon Status | Dungeon Event Die |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Calm           | d12               |
| Alert          | d10               |
| Alarmed        | d8                |
| Crisis         | d6                |

| Event Die | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | A **Wandering Encounter** is presented to the party. They will have to deal with it in a direct way before proceeding.                                                                            |
| 2-3       | **Altered Circumstances** indirectly affect the party. These can be environmental changes, faltering resources, or events that transpire out of the direct knowledge and perception of the party. |
| 4-6       | A **Sign, Omen, or Track** that hints at an impending Encounter or Event, or that reveals a secret, gives a hint about what has happened before, or what will happen soon.                        |
| 7+        | It is quiet, for now...                                                                                                                                                                           |


### Resting in a Dungeon
If the party wants to recover **Fatigue** while in a dungeon, they need to rest for a full Cycle. If they rest in an unsafe location in the dungeon, the GM will roll the Event Die. Any results come to pass at the end of the Cycle.

### Light in a Dungeon
If a dungeon has no light sources of its own, the party will need to carry at least one light source per three characters that travel close together. If there are not enough light sources to support the number of characters in the party, the characters furthest away from the light source are at a severe disadvantage. If someone without a Torch goes ahead of others, they will be left in the dark.

A regular Torch has 3 usage dots. Every 6 Dungeon Cycles of use, mark one usage dot on the Torch. You also mark one usage dot whenever you have to relight a Torch that was extinguished, either by choice or by bad luck.
