# Voidcrawling

Whenever your character or group moves through a horrible environment, unexpected events can happen. The procedure that is used to guide exploration and events is called the **Voidcrawling Procedure**. Each Voidcrawling Procedure consists of one or more **Voidcrawl Cycles**. Actions made in the Cycle might Tick the **Voidclock**.

---
### The Voidcrawl Cycle
1. The GM describes the environment and rehashes the current situation, giving any pertinent information that is immediately noticeable to the characters.
2. The players each declare which (one) action their characters will take during the cycle. Examples of common actions are:
    - Moving to a different area
    - Searching an area (particularly large locations might require you to state a specific area to search)
    - Keeping an eye out for dangers to avoid being surprised by anything unexpected
    - Overcome an obstacle in your way such as a locked door or blocking debris
3. Everyones' actions resolve simultaneously
4. The GM determines whether to Tick the **Voidclock**, and resolves any .
5. Any resources are checked against their duration, the GM's tools and tables are updated, and the Cycle repeats.

### The Voidclock
When crawling in a dangerous place, the **Voidclock** determines when wandering encounters and altered circumstances will befall the party.

The Voidclock starts at **20**. Each time the Clock Ticks, the GM rolls the **Void Die** and subtracts the amount from the Clock. If the Void Die rolls its maximum, it explodes: roll again immediately and Tick the Clock further.

The Clock Ticks when:
- Characters travel to a new location
- Characters traverse a sequence of previously explored locations
- Characters linger in an unsafe location
- Characters rest in an unsafe location
- Characters make a disturbance or cause a ruckus

Events transpire as the Clock Ticks down:

| Voidclock Count             | Event                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| When it first goes below 10 | **Altered Circumstances** |
| 1-3                         | **Sign or Omen**          |
| 0                           | **Wandering Encounter**   |

**Altered Circumstances** include: 
- the **Environment** changing in a meaningful way (passages get blocked/opened, what was once safe is not safe anymore)
- a **Choice** needing to be made (take a longer safer route, or a short but dangerous route)
- an unfortunate **Setback** befalls the party (Fatigue and hunger strike requiring a rest, or the Void wages attrition)

A **Sign or Omen** preludes the Wandering Encounter. Roll on the Encounter table and telegraph the impending event. Characters can respond to it and, if clever, may be able to avoid it.

The **Wandering Encounter** occurs at a distance appropriate to the situation and environment. If there hasn't been a Sign or Omen, the party may be Surprised.


##### Alerting the Void
The **Void Die** starts as a **d6**. Whenever the party alerts the environment or does something reckless, the Void Die steps up - to a max of **d12**. Laying low for a prolonged period of time - usually outside of the Void itself - causes the Void Die to step down. 

Alternatively use below descriptors to determine the Void Die Size:

| Descriptor | Void Die |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Calm       | d6       |
| Alert      | d8       |
| Alarmed    | d10      |
| Crisis     | d12      |

### Resting in the Void
Whenever the characters want to rest to regain their HP, they have to rest for a Cycle and consume a Ration. Resting in an unsafe location Ticks the Clock. If a Wandering Encounter happens during a rest, no rest is had.

If the party leaves the Void, they can take a safe rest and the Void Die steps down. However, consequences of the party's actions in the Void will alter the circumstances they find themselves in should they return...
