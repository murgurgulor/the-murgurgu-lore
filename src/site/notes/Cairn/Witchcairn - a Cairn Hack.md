# What's on the Character Sheet
### Attributes
There are three attributes: **Vigour** (VIG), **Clarity** (CLA), and **Spirit** (SPI).
- **Vigour** encompasses your physical strength, fortitude, and stamina. If you take physical damage, it lowers your Vigour.
- **Clarity** encompasses your agility, quick-thinking, and keen instincts. If you are met with disorienting circumstances or mind-muddling situations, it lowers your Clarity.
- **Spirit** encompasses your willpower, hope, and heart. If you are demoralized, intimidated, or otherwise disheartened, it lowers your Spirit.

Each attribute is ranked between 3 and 18, and you determine your starting score by rolling 3d6.

Whenever you perform a risky action, you roll a **Save** with the appropriate attribute. Your attributes can also decrease during play, lowering your chance of successful Saves and thereby increasing the risks you take with your actions. 

When an attribute reaches 0, you are either dead (VIG), unable to react to the world around you (CLA), or utterly hopeless (SPI).


### Guard
**Guard** (GD) represents your ability and capacity to avoid actual harm. When you are attacked and you are in a position where you could defend yourself to avoid harm, damage gets taken off your Guard before it lowers the appropriate Attribute. If this means the damage is fully absorbed by your Guard and no attribute damage has been taken, you've not taken any actual wounds: you've managed to protect yourself against it.

You determine your max GD by rolling 1d6. GD is recovered quickly: resting for a short time restores it back to full. 

During play, your max GD can increase by taking **Scars** in combat.


### Inventory
Your Inventory is a key aspect of the game. The items you carry define the actions you can take. Everyone has 10 Inventory Slots. 
- 1 Slot for each Hand
- 2 Slots on your Body
- 6 Slots in your Pack

Items in *At Hand* or *Body* slots are readily available for use, items in your *Pack* require time to recover in stressful situations.

You can carry a reasonable number of items beyond your Inventory Slots, but you become **Exposed** if you do so. You can also increase your carrying capacity by getting a cart or pack animal.

Items come in 3 varieties:
- **Normal** items occupy 1 slot. Some items have a restricted amount of uses before they're spent, for example a Torch can be lit 3 times before it expires.
- **Bulky** items occupy 2 slots
- **Petty** items occupy no slots, but a bunch of them can be bundled to occupy 1 slot. For example: 3 uses of Rations occupies one slot.


### Strain
Strain is a condition that represents fatigue and stress. It occupies 1 Inventory Slot, and until the Strain clears you can't use that slot for carrying items. If you have to take Strain when you're already at full Inventory, you either become **Exposed**, or you have to drop an item.

Strain can be gained from strenuous activites, not sleeping or resting enough, or overtaxing your body. Strain can accumulate, occupying one slot for each instance of Strain you have. You remove one instance of Strain after a full night's rest.


### Armor
Armor represents physical gear that blocks damage from incoming attacks. When you get attacked with a physical attack, you deduct your Armor value from the damage before applying it to your GD.

Armor from Shields only functions if the Shield is worn in an *At Hand* slot.
Armor from body pieces only functions if it is worn on a *Body* slot.

# The Rules of the Game
The rules of the game are straightforward. The GM describes the environment and your situation, and the player characters react to it. Characters can do anything they can be reasonably assumed to be capable of, keeping in mind their background and prior achievements. 

There are no rolls to see if you can do an activity. The intention is that the action is always moving forward and that it must present interesting choices. Failing to do something neither moves action forward nor presents an interesting choice. Therefore, you can do any action your character could reasonably do, but you might need to roll the dice to see if you can avoid harm when you do risky things.

There are no Knowledge- or Perception-type rolls. The GM gives any information a character would likely know/see with regards to their background or situation. Neither are there Persuasion-type rolls: you interact with an NPC as you would with a normal person, and they react according to their personality/motivations/beliefs.


### Taking Action
Whenever you want to take an action, you - and the GM - should keep in mind the following list:
1. **Intent** - What is it you are trying to achieve?
2. **Leverage** - What do you have, or what can you do, that makes this possibe?
3. **Cost** - Is there a cost to your action, either in resource, personal harm, or unwanted side-effects?
4. **Risk** - What's at risk with this action? If there is no risk, there is no roll.
5. **Impact** - The consequences of the action, honoring the intent, cost, and risks.

This sequence of events can be shorted to **ILCRI**. You can easily remember this with the following mnemonic: '*Intent, Leverage, Cost, Risk, Impact.*'


### Saves
The main roll in the game is the **Save**. You don't make a Save to see if you can do something, you make a Save **to avoid risk or harm** when you do something. If you take an action that doesn't have any risk involved, you don't need to roll a Save - you can just do it. 

Saves are made with one of the three attributes: VIG, CLA, or SPI. If you have to roll a Save, you roll a d20 and compare the result to the relevant attribute. If the result is **equal to or lower** than your attribute, you succeed in avoiding risk or harm. If it's **greater** than your attribute, you are subjected to risk or harm.

If two sides are in a contest, the individual that is **most at risk as a result of failure** has to make the Save.

If it's unclear if an action is risky enough to warrant a Save, the GM can check three factors: **Time**, **Gear**, and **Skill**.
- You have **Time** if there is nothing in your current situation that prevents you from taking as long as you need.
- You have **Gear** if you have items or the correct circumstances required to perform your task. Having a rope for climbing a wall counts as correct Gear, but the wall itself being rough and climable can also count as correct Gear.
- You have **Skill** if your character would be the kind of person who would be able to do the thing that you want to do.

After checking these factors, the GM decides:
- If you have zero or one, you probably can't do it
- If you have all three, you can probably do it
- If you have two, you can probably do it but you need to roll a Save to avoid a negative outcome


### Conditions
There are three Conditions that influence your character's capacities:
- **Exposed**: You are Exposed if you are encumbered (carrying more items than you have slots for) or otherwise unable to actively defend yourself. While you are Exposed, your Guard is treated as 0 and you can't recover it when resting.
- **Strain**: Strain can be gained in various ways, such as failed Saves, strenuous activities, casting magic spells, or staying up too late. Each instance of Strain occupies one Inventory Slot. A full night's rest removes one instance of Strain.
- **Deprived**: You're Deprived if you haven't had sufficient food, drink, or rest for 24 hours. When you're Deprived, you can't recover your Guard in a short rest. If you are Deprived for more than 24 hours, you take one instance of Strain for every day you're Deprived thereafter. As soon as you cure the source of your deprivation, you lose the condition.

# Combat
Combat is fast and dangerous. Any good hit could wound you, and death is lurking around every corner. Choose your fights carefully!

Combat is split up in rounds of roughly 10 seconds. Each round, every group of participants takes their actions at the same time. After every group ('side') has had their turn, a new round starts.


### Distance and Range
Everyone's distance to each other in combat is expressed in relative terms.
- **Engaged**: At arm's length. You need to be *Engaged* with an opponent in order to make a Melee Attack against them. You can't make a Ranged Attack if you start your turn *Engaged* with an enemy.
- **Nearby**: Within movement's distance. '*Across the room*.' You can make a Melee Attack against a *Nearby* target if your weapon has *Reach*.
- **Far Away**: More than a single movement away. '*Across the field*.'
- **Distant**: So far away that you can't make out details. Ranged Attacks at *Distant* targets are *Impaired*.

Using your movement in your turn can shift your relative distance up or down one category (so from being *Nearby* a monster to being *Engaged* with the monster for example, or moving from being *Far Away* from the main group of antagonists to being *Distant*). Using your action for extra movement allows you to shift an additional step.


### Initiative
Combat rounds are around 10 seconds long, and every character on the same side takes their actions simultaneously. When it's your side's turn, everyone needs to declare what their character is going to do before any dice are rolled. After everyone has declared their actions, they all get resolved simultaneously.

In a round, the player characters get to act first, followed by the opposing side(s).

If one of the sides surprises the other, they get to act before the other side gets to act. 
If neither side is surprised, each player character needs to pass a CLA Save in order to act in the first round of combat.


### Your Turn
When your side has its turn, you can declare movement and an action. You take your movement either **before** or **after** your action, you can't split it up around your action.

Switching an *At Hand* and *Body* item around doesn't count as an action and can be done freely.

Actions include:
- Making an attack and/or performing a Gambit
- Aid an ally in their action
- Use an *At Hand* or *Body* item
- Switching both *At Hand* and both *Body* items around, switching an *At Hand/Body* item with a *Pack* item, or giving an item to an ally
- Moving further than you would normally be able to
- Flee
- Parley
- Anything else that would reasonably fit in this list

You can also specify holding a specific action until a specific trigger occurs in the enemy's turn. You need to specify your action and the trigger on which you will unleash that action. You can't hold your action if you have moved in your turn, and you can't move thereafter.


### Attacking
There are no separate to-hit rolls. When you attack, you roll the attack dice of your weapons. The result of these dice compared to the Armor and GD of the target determine the effect of your attack. 

If your attack didn't deplete your enemy's Guard, you didn't wound your enemy. If your attack exceeds your enemy's Guard, any excess damage reduces their Vigour and you've wounded them.

Attack dice range from d4 for unarmed or *Impaired* attacks to d10 for big two-handed weapons.

Observe the following rules:
- You can't make a Ranged Attack if you start your turn *Engaged* with an opponent, even if you move away from them first.
- Ranged Attacks made against targets that are *Distant* are *Impaired*.
- Ammunition is not tracked, unless otherwise specified.

##### Multiple Attack Dice
If you attack an opponent with more than one weapon, or if more than one character attacks the same opponent, multiple attack dice get rolled.

In these situations, everyone rolls all applicable attack dice for their attack. After rolling, characters may expend any dice of 4 or higher to perform a **Gambit** (see below). Afterwards, only the **single highest remaining value** is applied as damage.

**Example**
Yan is wielding two daggers. Each dagger has a d6 attack die. When Yan attacks an enemy with both his daggers, he rolls 1d6 twice and applies the highest number rolled as damage.

Yokel is wielding a longsword and a shield. The longsword has a d8 attack die, the shield a d4. When Yokel attacks an enemy with his sword and a shield bash, he roll 1d8 and 1d4 and applies the highest number rolled as damage.

##### Attack Dice Modifiers
There are several modifiers that affect your attack dice:
- **Impaired**: If you make an attack from a position of weakness or disadvantage, your attack is *Impaired*. When your attack is *Impaired*, you roll only a **single d4** for this attack, regardless of the weapons you use. Ranged Attacks made against *Distant* enemies are always *Impaired*, and attacks made with *Reach* weapons in confined spaces may also be *Impaired*.
- **Bonus Dice**: If a particular circumstance works in your benefit, you can get a bonus attack die on your attack. Usually this is *+d8*, which means you roll a d8 in addition to your normal attack dice and - as usual - keep the single highest value. You can also use this bonus die for a Gambit. Depending on the circumstances, you might get to roll a bigger die for bonus damage. The **Frenzy** Feat can give you a *+d12* bonus die, for example.
- **Blast**: A Blast attack affects multiple targets close together. Roll the attack dice for each target separately. If it's unsure how many targets a Blast would affect, roll the relevant attack die to determine the number of targets.

---
### Gambits
Gambits are maneuvers you can make to apply a **temporary effect** on your target. You can choose to perform a Gambit after you've rolled your attack dice, but before damage is applied.

You can perform a Gambit by expending any attack die of **4 or higher** from your roll. When you expend the die, you take it off the table and it is no longer considered when determining the single highest value for damage. 
If the die you expended for the Gambit was **8 or higher**, your target either doesn't get a chance to resist the effect, or you can ask for a greater or longer lasting effect from the GM.

When you perform a Gambit, the target of the Gambit must be the target of the attack. 

Targets get to make a **VIG Save** to avoid the effect of a Gambit - with the exception of the *Bolster* and *Move* Gambit. If you expend an 8+ die for the Gambit, you can deny the target their Save.

If multiple characters perform a Gambit against the same target at the same time, they can't perform the same Gambit. 

Gambits can never do something that would outright end combat, they only give a temporary advantage.


The Gambits are:
- **Bolster**: Add +1 to the attack's total damage.
- **Move**: Move after your attack, even if you have already moved or are unable to move.
- **Repel**: Force an opponent away from you. 
- **Stop**: Prevent an opponent from moving on their next turn.
- **Impair**: Impair a weapon, or otherwise weaken one attacking power of an opponent on their next turn.
- **Expose**: Negate the opponent's sources of Armor for the round, or otherwise weaken one defensive aspect of the opponent.
- **Dismount**: Dismount a mounted opponent.
- **Something else** that would reasonably fit in the above list.

**Example**
Characters Yan and Yokel both declare to attack the same creature. Yan is wielding two daggers, Yokel a longsword and shield. When their action resolves, Yan rolls 1d6 twice and Yokel rolls 1d8 and 1d4. They come up with 2, 4, 5, 4 respectively. Yan and Yokel decide to expend both 4's to perform two Gambits. They can't choose the same Gambit twice, so Yan will *Bolster* to increase the attack's damage, and Yokel will *Repel* the creature away - for which the creature gets a VIG Save to avoid the effect.

After Yan and Yokel expend the Gambit dice, only the 2 and 5 remain. The 5 gets applied as damage to the creature, +1 from Yan's *Bolster* for a total of 6 damage.


---
### Feats
Every character can perform the following 3 Feats in combat. A Feat is a special maneuver that you make on your attack or as a response to someone else's attack. You can only apply one Feat per character per attack. 

After you perform a Feat, roll the associated Save. If you fail this Save, you have taxed yourself. You can't perform any more Feats until you've had a rest.

The Feats are:
- **Frenzy** (*VIG Save*): You declare to Frenzy *when you declare your attack, before the attack dice have been rolled*. When you Frenzy, choose one effect on your attack:
	- You get *+d12* bonus damage
	- Your attack gains the *Blast* property
	- You leave a specific physical mark on your enemy, if this attack Wounds your opponent 
- **Focus** (*CLA Save*): You declare to Focus *after you've rolled your attack dice, but before damage is applied*. When you Focus, you can perform a Gambit against your opponent without expending an attack die. 
- **Fend** (*SPI Save*): You declare to Fend *when you or an ally at arm's length are hit with an attack*. When you Fend, you can choose to discard one of the attacker's attack dice. 


---
# Getting Hurt
When enemies attack you, follow this procedure:
- Consider the attack dice rolled by the opponents
- Choose whether you (or one of your ally's) wants to **Fend**
- Deduct your Armor value from the single highest value die remaining.
- Apply the remaining damage to your Guard. 
	- If you have at least 1 GD remaining, you have evaded the attack.
	- If this brings your GD exactly to 0, you take a **Scar**.
	- If this exceeds your GD, any excess damage is applied to your Vigour
- If you take damage to your Vigour, immediately make a VIG Save using your new score. 
	- If you succeed you are **Wounded** but still in the game.
	- If you fail, you are **Mortally Wounded** - you're down and dying, and if untended to you die within the hour. An ally taking time to bandage you up will stabilize you and bring your from Mortally Wounded to simply Wounded.
- If damage reduces your Vigour to 0, you die. 

Note that GD only protects you from damage that you could *reasonably prevent*. Damage from other sources, such as falling from a great height or ingesting poison, is applied directly to your Vigour but does not per se trigger a VIG Save.


### Scars
When an attack in combat reduces your GD to exactly 0, you take a Scar. The amount of GD you lost in the attack that gave you the Scar determines the effect. Consult the table below.

| GD Lost | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 GD    | **Lasting Scar**: Roll 1d6 to determine the location - 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Then, roll 1d6: if the result is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                                                          |
| 2 GD    | **Rattling Blow**: You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3 GD    | **Walloped**: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are **Deprived** until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max GD.                                                                                                                                            |
| 4 GD    | **Broken Limb**: Roll 1d6 to determine the bone - 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended,roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                                                                          |
| 5 GD    | **Disease**: Your wound gets afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result.                                                                                                                                          |
| 6 GD    | **Reorienting Head Wound**: Roll 1d6 \| 1-2: VIG, 3-4: CLA, 5-6: SPI. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current attribute, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 7 GD    | **Hamstrung**: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max CLA, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 8 GD    | **Deafened**: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a SPI save. If you pass, increase your max SPI by 1d4.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9 GD    | **Re-brained**: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max SPI, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10 GD   | **Sundered**: An appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless (the GM will tell you which.) Then make a SPI save. If you pass, increase your max SPI by 1d6.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 11 GD   | **Mortal Wound**: You are **Deprived** and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max GD.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12 GD   | **Doomed**: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. You are out of action until you've had a day to recover. Afterwards, your next VIG Save from a Wound determines your fate. If it is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max GD, take the new result. |

### Recovering
To recover your GD, you need to rest for around 10 minutes and consume a Ration. Afterwards, your GD is fully recovered. 

The ability to perform Feats again is regained after a short break.

Attribute Damage is recovered at one point per night's rest. If multiple attributes are damaged, choose which one to recover a point in each day.

All Attribute Damage is fully recovered after a full week's dedicated rest.

# The Armory

### Melee Weapons
Melee Weapons are divided in three categories:

**Light Weapons** (*d6*) 
Light Weapons are small weapons that can easily be dual wielded, or that can be concealed on your body. 
Light Weapons have a d6 as their attack die.
Examples of Light Weapons are daggers, clubs, handaxes, brass knuckles, etc.

**Balanced Weapons** (*d8*)
Balanced Weapons are weapons of some size that require precision and balance to effectively wield. Balanced weapons can be combined with a Shield or a Light Weapon, but not with another Balanced Weapon. You can't easily conceal them on your body. 
Balanced Weapons have a d8 as their attack die.
Examples of Balanced Weapons are longsword, spears, maces, battleaxes, etc.

**Great Weapons** (*d10*)
Great Weapons are weapons that require both hands to wield. They are a large size and have a large reach, but that may become a hindrance in restricted spaces.
Great Weapons have a d10 as their attack die. They are *Bulky* and have *Reach*, but attacks with Great Weapons in confined spaces are *Impaired*.
Examples of Great Weapons are greatswords, glaives, halberds, longspears, etc.

**Special**
If you wield a Shield, you can use it as a weapon to Shield Bash. A Shield Bash has a d4 attack die. If you Shield Bash, you can't use your Shield for Armor for the remainder of the round.


### Ranged Weapons
Ranged Weapons can't be used if you start your turn *Engaged* with an opponent.
Ranged Weapons can target anyone you can see, but attacks against *Distant* targets are *Impaired*.

**One-handed Ranged Weapons**
- Sling: d4 attack die, considered a Light Weapon for purposes of dual wielding.
- Javelin: d6 attack die, considered a Balanced Weapon for purposes of dual wielding.

**Two-handed (*Bulky*) Ranged Weapons**
- Bow: d6 attack die
- Crossbow: d8 attack die, and has to be reloaded as an action after each attack.


### Armor
- **Shield**: +1 Armor, must be worn in an *At Hand* slot
	- Can be used to **Shield Bash** for d4, but you lose the Armor value until your next turn.
- **Light Armor** (Gambeson, Chain Shirt): +1 Armor, must be worn in a *Body* slot
- **Heavy Armor** (Chain Mail, Breastplate): +2 Armor, *Bulky*, must be worn in both *Body* slots
- **Plate Mail**: +3 Armor, *Bulky*, must be worn in both *Body* slots. Difficult to move around in.

Magic is contained in **Runestones**. Runestones are stones veined with a rare star metal that acts as a conduit between the wielder's intent and the physical reality. Each Runestone is inscribed with two runes of the Ur-language. These Runes are difficult to directly translate and can have many different meanings based on the circumstances and intent.

When you wield a Runestone, you can focus your energy on visualizing an intended effect on the physical world that could be described with the Ur-Runes on the stone. The GM will tell you to what extent your effect is achievable.

**Example**
If you wield a Runestone with the runes '*Expanding Mind*', one application could be to temporarily enhance someone's cognitive capacities in order to solve a difficult problem. A different application could be to enlarge an opponent's brain in their skull to hurt them. A third application could be to establish some form of telepathy between several people and create a temporary hivemind.

### Channeling Runestones
Channeling your energy through a Runestone requires freedom of body and mind. You can only use a Runestone if you have **at least one empty Inventory Slot**. After you've used the Runestone, you take one **Strain** from the mental efforts.

If you try to channel a Runestone in a particularly tense or dangerous situation, there's a chance of the magic backfiring on you. The GM can require you to make a SPI Save, and on a failed save there will be an unforeseen and unfortunate side-effect to your magic.


### Magical Effects
The effects of magic are broad and difficult to define. In general, keep in mind the following types of effects you can achieve with magic:
- Create a unique circumstance to fix an issue or solve a problem
- Bypass a situation that could normally require you to make a Save
- Bypass a situation that could normally require you to have a specific skill or resource
- Hinder of aid actions of others
- Deal damage (*d8*, or *d6 Blast*) to targets that are *Engaged* or *Nearby*
	- Or: deal direct attribute damage (*d4*) if the target fails a Save

### Extra Effort
If you want to achieve an effect that's greater than listed above - such as affecting more than one target, covering a larger area or range, enhancing the overall effect, or any combination thereof - you will have to put in extra **Effort**. 

Putting in **Effort** requires you to have an additional empty Inventory Slot available per Effort expended. You can expend Effort up to a maximum of three times per casting (requiring a total of 4 empty Inventory Slots to do so: one of the base casting, and one for each extra Effort). However, you can share the Effort with one other person, providing they are willing, have empty Inventory Slots, and they hold your hand.

For each Effort you put in, roll a d6. For each die that comes up as a 1-3 you take an additional instance of **Strain** after the magical effect has passed. Additionally, if one or more of the dice comes up as a 1, the Runestone is tapped out and can't be used again until it is recharged. Each Runestone has a specific recharge ritual related to the Runes it holds.


### Random Runestones
If you happen to find a random Runestone, the Ur-Runes inscribed are randomly determined according to the spell generation methods of the TTRPG *Maze Rats*:
