The game is a conversation. When you play your Spy, you narrate their actions as the story develops. Your character can attempt to do all the things that a Spy would be able to do given the circumstances (you must have **narrative permission**). When you narrate your Spy taking a certain action they could conceivably do and there’s no reason why you shouldn’t simply fail or succeed, the conversation continues with the action resulting in the definite result. If success or failure are not certain, however, a roll of the dice will decide the outcome after which the conversation continues again. These situations are guided by two mechanics: **Moves** and **Approaches**.

---
###  Moves
A **Move** is a mechanic that can trigger during the conversation. It’s a rule that tells you what narrative triggers it and what the effect on the conversation is. Every Move requires a fictional action to be taken and ultimately has an effect on the fiction. Whenever you narrate your spy doing something that triggers a Move, that Move happens and all its rules apply. You can’t do something that triggers a Move without that Move triggering, and you can’t trigger a Move without doing what triggers the Move.

A Move looks like this:

>##### Move Name
>When **fiction that triggers the move**, [roll the dice if a roll is required].
>
>---
>- Outcome of the Move, depending on the outcome of the roll if a roll took place.
>- *If a Move has a choice of outcomes, the Move instructs you who chooses what.*

There are two different categories of Moves. **[[_archive/Encuentro Espías/Game Mechanics/Basic Moves\|Basic Moves]]** are moves that every Spy can trigger. **Specialty Moves** are Moves that are unique to each Spy. You can’t trigger a Specialty Move if it’s not on your Spy sheet.

### Approaches
Often, different tasks or challenges can be handled in different ways. An **Approach** is a description of how you attempt to reach a goal or result. It’s not what you do (that’s covered by a **Move**) but how you do it. This is different from the general concept of ‘skills’ that describe exactly how good you are at a specific action. To draw a parallel with D&D 5e: a Move is like a skill, and an Approach is like the ability score you attach to the skill. There are 6 Approaches:

- **Agility**: When you use Agility to reach your result, you rely on speed, dexterity, alacrity and fluidity of mind and body to get the job done.
- **Flair**: When you handle a situation with Flair, you boldly approach it with charisma, leadership and style. You don't care if you'll draw all eyes on yourself or that you eschew social conventions: you apply your self-confidence and swagger to whatever task it is.
- **Focus**: When you try to attain a goal through Focus, you make sure you take your time and that you pay attention to detail so the task is properly executed on the first attempt.
- **Force**: When you take an action with Force, you display brute strength of body or mind rather than subtlety. Rather than avoiding something bad, you just stand there and weather the storm. This does not always mean violence: threatening someone, demanding authority and standing there to take a punch to the face are all feats of Force.
- **Guile**: When you approach something with Guile, you take an effort focusing on misdirection, stealth or deceit. The best outcome of your Guile is that you get what you want without anyone ever noticing it.
- **Wit**: When you approach a problem with Wit, you’re using quick and rational thinking, trying to solve complex problems or account for numerous variables at once.

Each Approach is rated for your Spy with a number ranging from 0 to 3. Higher rated Approaches have a higher chance of success when you roll the dice.

### Dice Resolution
Once you’ve triggered a **Move** and stated the **Approach** you wish to take with the Move, the dice determine what the outcome is. When you have to roll dice, **you roll a number of d6 equal to the Approach’s rating for your character**. If your Spy is trying to lie their way past some guards and your character’s Guile rating is 2, you roll 2d6. You may sometimes need to roll 0d6. This means you roll 1d6 **twice** and keep the **lowest** result.

Generally the dice pools will be between 0d6 and 3d6, but penalties or bonuses may add or subtract additional dice. This is signified in the text as ‘**take +#d**’ or ‘**take -#d**’, where the # determines how many dice you add or subtract from your pool. If a Move tells you to **take +1d forward**, it means that for your next dice roll you roll a number of d6 equal to your Approach’s rating plus one. If a Move uses the word ‘**ongoing**’, it means you take a bonus or penalty die on every dice roll that meets specific conditions. 

If a penalty would cause you to roll below 0d6, you don’t roll: **you automatically fail**.

After you’ve rolled the dice, the **highest number rolled** (or lowest with 0d6) determines the outcome:

- If the highest number rolled is **3 or lower**, it _Goes Poorly_: you don’t achieve your intended result and a complication may occur, or you achieve your intended result at a major cost.  
- If the highest number rolled is **4 or 5**, it _Goes Reasonably Well_: you do it, but with trouble or it comes with a cost or complication.  
- If the highest number rolled is a **6**, it _Goes Very Well_: you do it with little to no trouble.

The Move you’ve triggered will usually state what happens when it Goes Very Well (‘**On a 6, …**’) and when it Goes Reasonably Well (‘**On a 4-5, …**’). If it’s not written in the Move what happens when it Goes Poorly (‘**On a 3-, …**’), the GM decides what happens. Generally this will mean that you’ve failed to achieve your intended result, but it’s also a trigger for the GM to make a Move against you. The GM making a move can mean some type of complication or something unfortunate will occur, or it may be a disastrous consequence.

### Being Taken Out
The game is not about physical violence, it’s about covert operations. Spies don’t have Hit Points or other health indicators, instead each Spy has 3 checkboxes that represent their **Cover**. Whenever you get caught doing something suspicious, you cross off a box. There are three situations in which you have to cross off a box:

1. It’s been said or hinted at that someone could catch you in the act, and you decided to ignore it;
2. When a Move tells you to;
3. When an action Goes Poorly, at the GM’s discretion.

When all your Cover boxes are crossed off, you are **Suspected**. Being Suspected triggers a special Basic Move (**Walking on Thin Ice**) that places you under scrutiny and has you at risk of being uncovered!
