# What is Thaumachrome
Thaumachromium, or thaumachrome as it's colloquially known, is best described as an insubstantial state of energy that blankets the planet like an atmosphere. It doesn't appear to be either a gas, liquid, solid or plasma. Its natural state is inert, but it can be used by individuals with a specific predisposed proficiency and capacity to fuel the manifestation of extraordinary effects that defy natural law. 

These individuals have existed since the dawn of humanity and their powers were initially ascribed to divine sources, claiming them servants or avatars of the gods. The rise of science in the past two hundred years has developed an understanding of the nature and mechanics of the thaumachrome and these individuals, and has rejected the theory of divine forces. Though the scientific method has enthralled a large part of the world, a significant portion still holds to the religious angle.

Thaumachrome is normally imperceptible for humans. Through scientific advancements, its presence has been demonstrated through specific combinations of environment and stimuli. Early of such experiments caused the thaumachrome to release its latent energy in a single bright flash. Those who witnessed such experiments all claimed to have seen the flash as a different colour, their experiences combined covering the entire spectrum of visible light. It was Rebar Pershwa who then named it "Thaumachromium, or the Colour of Magic" in her revolutionary thesis De Scientia Magicae, which laid the foundation of modern thaumachromic research. 

Harvesting and utilizing the thaumachrome as an energy source for machinery or to be wielded by any individual is a very active field of study, but it hasn't yielded many promising results as of yet.

### The Manifesting of Thaumachrome 
Through scientific advancements, much has been learned about the interaction between the thaumachrome and humans. It doesn't seem like animals have any relevant interactions with the thaumachrome. Some theories argue it requires a certain level of intelligence or self-awareness, others claim evolutionary roots to these observations.

Every human has a Thaumachromic Reserve: an amount of thaumachrome that is stored in their body - specifically in the eyes. For most of humanity this reserve is minimal, but a portion of the population - a few percent - has a greater reserve. These people can use their thaumachromic reserve as a source of power to produce magical effects. This ability is negligible or absent in individuals with small thaumachromic reserves. 

The act of creating extraordinary effects through the thaumachrome is called Manifesting the Thaumachrome. The effects are similarly called Manifestations, and those who can create them are called Manifesters, though some still use the archaic name Mages. Though a wide range of Manifestations can be created, Manifesters are usually only proficient in a few areas of Manifestations. Some proficiencies tend to run in families, but even within families there can be a wide variety of proficiencies. Some theories claim that the proficiencies are linked to an individual's temperament and personality, but a true explanation hasn't been reached.

The different types of Manifestations are categorized in three broad categories: Physical Manifestations, Metaphysical Manifestations and Existential Manifestations. Proficiency in one or more Physical Manifestations are most common among Manifesters, with proficiency in Metaphysical Manifestations being uncommon and proficiency in Existential Manifestations a rare occurrence.

### The Science of Manifesting 
When a Manifester manifests the thaumachrome, they use their thaumachromic reserve to fuel their abilities. This causes their thaumachromic reserve to be expended. Greater Manifestations drain more thaumachrome than smaller ones, and prolonged Manifestations drain more thaumachrome than brief effects. When an individual's thaumachromic reserve is empty, they can't fuel any Manifestations.

As a Manifester creates an effect over a greater distance, it requires more thaumachrome and the effect becomes less accurate. This is similar to throwing a stone: it takes more energy to throw a stone over a greater distance, and the further away you throw it the less likely it is you hit your intended target. However, similar to throwing stones, the more experienced a Manifester becomes, the more they improve their ability to Manifest accurately over large distances.

When Manifesting the thaumachrome, the Manifester can spread out their effects as an undiscriminating blanket, affecting everything around them. This requires little to no concentration, but there's no distinction made in who or what gets affected. Manifesters can also focus their abilities on specific targets or areas. This requires more concentration from the Manifester but can generally be combined with other tasks, if the flow of thaumachrome is kept at a constant rate.

If the Manifester chooses, they can focus their abilities on specific targets or areas as well as accurately control the flow of thaumachrome to create the exact results they want. The process of dynamically controlling and adjusting the amount of thaumachrome used is also called 'Ebbing and Flowing'. This is more conservative of the thaumachromic reserve and creates more desired results, but generally requires the full attention of the Manifester. Sometimes Manifesters are paired with an individual to give that person just the effects they need when they need it. Beyond great skill and concentration from the Manifester, this also requires a good bond, camaraderie and understanding between the two. 

##### Thaumachromic Regeneration
An individual's thaumachromic reserve is filled through natural diffusion. When an individual's thaumachromic reserve is empty, the gradient between their reserve and the ambient thaumachrome causes an influx of thaumachrome into the Manifester. This is called Thaumachromic Regeneration. The speed of this diffusion slows the closer the reserve is to being filled. Generally an empty reserve is mostly filled after a full day. 

Ambient thaumachrome has displayed differing densities across the planet, with higher densities in areas of greater human population. Areas with minimal or no human population hold extremely low concentrations of thaumachrome. Extremely high or extremely low ambient densities of thaumachrome can influence the rate of thaumachromic regeneration through higher or lower gradients. In high density areas - like large metropolitan cities - full thaumachromic regeneration can take as short as 14 hours. In low density areas full regeneration can sometimes take several days. Some desolated areas are so devoid of ambient thaumachrome that a Manifester's reserve might never be fully filled. These areas are called Dead Zones.

Manifesters with some experience can accurately sense their remaining reserve and how fast a particular Manifestation is draining it. They can also sense how fast their reserve is being filled in their current environment and have a good idea of what level of reserve they require to produce certain effects. Science can also measure and quantify these properties, though it provides little additional information to a Manifester's innate sense.

### Physical Signs of Manifesters
As thaumachrome is stored in the eyes, those with large reserves can also show physical signs of their capacity in their eyes. With sufficient enough reserves, the irises take on the look of swirling vortices. As thaumachromic reserve gets depleted through use, the vortex stills as well. When reserve gets filled through thaumachromic regeneration, the vortex regenerates as well. 

Science and the criminal justice system have shown together that removing one's eyes also removes their ability for storing thaumachrome - and with it the ability to Manifest. Manifesters who have used their powers for evil are sometimes punished accordingly by having one or both of their eyes removed.

Those who have lived for a longer time with great thaumachromic capacities can outwardly show their abilities in another way. Prolonged containment of thaumachrome causes it to leak out into the blood stream in small quantities. Thaumachrome stains the blood a darker colour, nearing black in some cases. It also stains the blood vessels, creating a dark web of superficial veins that can be seen through the skin. Some take great pride in their power and accentuate this physical sign by tracing their dark veins with tattoos to make them more prominent. They usually shave their head bald to tattoo and show the pattern on their skull as well. Sometimes they add stylistic flourishes to the tattooed web, but this is a very personal choice.

# Manifestations 
Thaumachrome can be channeled into different effects called Manifestations. There are 8 types of Manifestation identified. Four of these have a directly perceivable effect on the natural elements: Fire, Water, Air and Earth. These Manifestations are called the Physical Manifestations, though some refer to them as the Elemental Manifestations. 

The other four Manifestations are not as easily defined and have a less tangible and perceivable effect. They have been called Force, Mind, Growth and Decay. Two of these Manifestations - Force and Mind - are called the Metaphysical Manifestations. The other two - Growth and Decay - are called the Existential Manifestations. 

Metaphysical Manifestations can be combined with Physical Manifestations to achieve new effects - but not with each other. The Existential Manifestations can be combined with any other Manifestation to achieve new effects. 

Through single and combined use of Manifestations a total of 29 different Manifested effects can be achieved.

### Physical Manifestations 
The Physical Manifestations each affect one of the elements directly. It requires a source of that element to manipulate. The thaumachrome can then be used to shape, control and direct their element.

###### Fire
Fire Manifestations manipulate existing fires. It can alter the fire's intensity and shape, and the fire can be directed to move in any way the caster desires.

###### Water 
Water Manifestations manipulate existing bodies of water. It can alter the water's flow, speed and it can be directed to move in any way the caster desires.

###### Air 
Air Manifestations manipulate the current of air. It can create gusts, whirlwinds and drafts of varying size and intensity.

###### Earth 
Earth Manifestations manipulate geological substances such as sand, stone, and even metal. It can be used to shape and move the ground, or move these substances in any way the caster desires.

---

### Metaphysical Manifestations 
Metaphysical Manifestations are not as clearly visible and tangible as Physical Manifestations. They deal with unseen and unmeasurable forces that deal with energy and cognition. The Metaphysical Manifestations can be combined with Physical Manifestations to give them new effects based on their metaphysical properties, but they can't be combined with each other. The Metaphysical Manifestations are Force and Mind. 

###### Force 
Manifesting Force means an unseen, untethered force is created against an opposing body. This can be used to deliver an opposing counterforce, or to deflect movement by redirecting the momentum. Force Manifestations can practically be used to block, move, guide, push and pull anything with a physical structure. The amount and duration of force exerted is connected to the amount of thaumachrome used.

###### Mind 
Manifesting Mind means tapping into a creature's cognitive energy. Through this cognitive energy, the caster can glean surface emotions or thoughts. The caster can amplify or decrease cognitive energy, causing a direct influence on those feelings and emotions.

--- 

#### Metaphysical Manifestations combined with Physical Manifestations 
When Metaphysical Manifestations are combined with Physical Manifestations, their effects target living creatures only. The caster can choose to spread out a blanket effect, or choose to focus the effect on a single or several specific creatures.

###### Might (Force/Fire)
Manifesting Force and Fire increases the target's physical energy and strength. It allows the target to feel physically energized and it enhances their physical strength beyond normal human limits. This effect does not heal any pre-existing fatigue, which will return as soon as the manifesting ends. It also has no effect on mental awareness and tiredness.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to cause heart palpitations. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to throw the target off-balance or mess with their momentum and movements through the rapidly changing physical abilities.

###### Vigilance (Mind/Fire)
Manifesting Mind and Fire increases the target's mental awareness and awakeness. It allows the target to push through mental fatigue and stay awake and alert. It does not heal any pre-existing fatigue, which will return as soon as the manifesting ends.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to cause anxiety. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to confuse the target through the rapidly changing mental states.

###### Anodyne (Force/Water) 
Manifesting Force and Water masks any feelings of physical pain or fatigue from the target, allowing them to continue past their limit. It does not add any extra energy, it removes the feelings of being tired and hurting that are there. When the manifesting stops, the hurt returns.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can force the target to go beyond their limit. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to throw the target off-balance or mess with their momentum and movements through the rapidly changing physical abilities.

###### Tranquility (Mind/Water)
Manifesting Mind and Water masks any feelings of fear, worry, anxiety or any other troubles. It allows the target to continue on their set path without being overcome by negative emotions. When the manifesting stops, the emotions return.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to make the target uncaring and unflinching, causing them to go into situations without acknowledging the dangers. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to confuse the target through the rapidly changing mental states.

###### Celerity (Force/Air)
Manifesting Force and Air increases the target's physical reflexes, movement speed and agility. It allows for faster movements of the body than normally capable. This uses up more of the target's energy. It does not increase cognitive speed or mental processing. When the manifesting stops, it might take the target a few seconds to readjust to their normal speed.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to quickly drain the target's energy levels. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to throw the target off-balance or mess with their momentum and movements through the rapidly changing physical abilities.
 
###### Wit (Mind/Air)
Manifesting Mind and Air increases the target's cognitive speed, mental processing and perception. They receive and process more sensory input and at a quicker pace. It does not increase physical reflexes or movement speed. When the manifesting stops, the target's thinking might feel dull or sluggish for a few seconds.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to overload the target with sensory input. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to confuse the target through the rapidly changing mental states.

###### Resistance (Force/Earth)
Manifesting Force and Earth increases the target's physical integrity and density. They become harder to injure and withstand more hurt without being physically affected. They become harder to move from their place through external forces, but their movement speed also is slowed. When the manifesting stops, the target might overreach or move too eagerly for a moment.

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to ground the target to a halt, allowing for bypassing or repositioning of others. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to throw the target off-balance or mess with their momentum and movements through the rapidly changing physical abilities.

###### Focus (Mind/Earth)
Manifesting Mind and Earth increases the target's ability to focus, drowning out any outside interference or unwanted sensory input. They become solely focused on the task they're performing and can be slower to respond to other input. When the manifesting stops, the target might temporarily try to focus on everything happening around them, becoming distracted. 

If wanting to use offensively, the caster can burst their Manifestation to force the target to focus on a single thing, becoming unaware of any other threats or dangers around them. They can ebb and flow the thaumachrome to confuse the target through the rapidly changing mental states.

### Existential Manifestations 
The Existential Manifestations deal with the forces of life and death. They can be combined with any other Manifestation to give them new effects based on their part in the cycle of existence. The Existential Manifestations can also be combined with each other, but due to their nature they achieve a net zero effect. The Existential Manifestations are Growth and Decay.

###### Growth 
Growth enhances and expedites the natural propagation, development and healing of the target. When used, it draws on the target's own energy to fuel the enhancement.

Additionally Growth can be used to create fields of positive thaumachromic pressure. When this is used to create an area of positive pressure around a target, the higher gradient causes increased thaumachromic regeneration. 

Alternatively it lessens the thaumachromic expenditure of Manifestations, allowing greater effects for smaller costs. This is usually a noticeable but modest increase.  This application of Growth can also be used to increase and/or prolong the effect of a different Manifestation, feeding ambient thaumachrome as additional fuel.

###### Decay 
Decay decreases or halts the natural propagation, development and healing of the target. It does not actively cause decay or reversal of growth. Any energy leeched in this way is lost.

Additionally Decay can be used to create fields of negative thaumachromic pressure. When this is used to create an area of negative pressure around a target, the reversed gradient causes their thaumachromic reserve to leak out. 

Alternatively it increases the thaumachromic expenditure of Manifestations, allowing lesser effects for greater costs. This is usually a noticeable but modest decrease. This application of Decay can also be used to decrease and/or dispel the effect of a different Manifestation, drawing its fuel away into ambient thaumachrome.

###### Cycle (Growth/Decay)
Theoretically a caster proficient in both Growth and Decay can combine the Manifestations. Due to their effects, this ends up as a net zero effect and is therefore not considered a relevant interaction.

---

#### Existential Manifestations combined with Metaphysical Manifestations 
When the Existential Manifestations are combined with the Metaphysical Manifestations, their effects become the powers to give or take away physical and cognitive existence. This can target living creatures only.

###### Restoration (Growth/Force)
Manifesting Growth and Force increases the target's natural growing and healing, but this process is fueled by the thaumachrome rather than the target's own energy. This allows for powerful healing of wounds or wild propagation of plants.

###### Destruction (Decay/Force)
Manifesting Decay and Force actively dissolves the target's natural state, fueled by the thaumachrome. This means their energy gets depleted and their body starts to fail and wither.

###### Wisdom (Growth/Mind)
Manifesting Growth and Mind increases the target's cognitive capacity, increasing their intelligence and the strength of their cognitive energy. Afflicted minds, as with dementia, are temporarily restored as long as the Manifestation holds. Prolonged or intensive Manifestations may leave some permanent effects.

###### Madness (Decay/Mind)
Manifesting Decay and Mind diminishes the target's cognitive capacity, making them insane, delusional or feebleminded for as long as the Manifestation holds. Prolonged or intensive Manifestations may leave some permanent effects.

---

#### Existential Manifestations combined with Physical Manifestations 
When Existential Manifestations are combined with Physical Manifestations, they produce effects that are linked to the essence of life and death that each physical element represents. The physical element does not need to be present for the Manifestation to take effect.

###### Light (Growth/Fire)
Manifesting Growth and Fire creates light and heat out of the thaumachrome. 

###### Dark (Decay/Fire) 
Manifesting Decay and Fire creates darkness impenetrable by normal light sources and cold impenetrable by natural sources of warmth. 

###### Sustenance (Growth/Water)
Manifesting Growth and Water provides nourishment for living creatures, fulfilling any bodily need for food or drink.

###### Famine (Decay/Water)
Manifesting Decay and Water leeches nourishment from a target, making them hungry and thirsty or in extreme cases even starving and dehydrated.

###### Breath (Growth/Air)
Manifesting Growth and Air removes the need for a target creature to breathe. It can also be used to create an area of increased air pressure without manipulating the airflow.

###### Void (Decay/Air)
Manifesting Decay and Air increases the need for breath and the work of breathing for a target. It can also be used to create an area of decreased air pressure or a vacuum.

###### Bond (Growth/Earth)
Manifesting Growth and Earth generates positive connections of a target to the world around them. It makes them more likely to be understood and feel united with others.

###### Solitude (Decay/Earth)
Manifesting Decay and Earth generates negative connections of a target to the world around them, or inhibits any connections from being made. It creates animosity and distrust between the target and others, or a desolate loneliness.
