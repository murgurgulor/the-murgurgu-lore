# H1r0, the Ninja
The child of the corrupt chief of police, IRL they are powerless to stop the evil of the world. But, in Cyberspace, they are H1r0.

**Compatible cliques**: Not great with people IRL, H1r0 does impress certain kinds of alternative kids online and - due to their family background - can fake it sometimes with suits, sellouts, and general rich people.
