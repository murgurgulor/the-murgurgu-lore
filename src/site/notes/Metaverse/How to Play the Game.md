The game is a conversation. When you play your Hacker, you narrate their actions as the story develops. Your character can attempt to do all the things that an Avatar in the Metaverse would be able to do given the circumstances. This is called **Narrative Permission** to perform an action. When you narrate your Hacker taking a certain action for which they have **Narrative Permission** and there's no reason why they shouldn't simply fail or succeed, the GM adjudicates the result of the action and the conversation continues. If success or failure are not certain, however, a roll of the dice will decide the outcome: the **Action Roll**. After the GM adjudicates this resolution, the conversation continues again.

# Attributes
There are two categories of Attributes that make up your Hacker: 4 **Approaches** and 4 **Aptitudes**. Each of these 8 Attributes has a score ranging from 0 to 2. When you make an **Action Roll**, you combine an **Approach** with an **Aptitude** and roll a dice pool of d6 equal to the cumulative score of the two.

## Approaches
Each Hacker has a personality that determines how they generally approach problems. These are divided into 4 **Approaches** that cover a wide range of avenues. With each Approach you might take, there's a specific **Risk** you attempt to mitigate, and a specific **Consequence** of taking that Approach.

It's not uncommon for two Approaches to be applicable to a certain situation. In particular there can be a blurry line between **Forceful** and **Bold**, and **Clever** and **Sneaky**. If a situation arises where the GM states multiple Approaches could be applicable, the player chooses which one they use for their Action Roll. They can take their score in the Approach into account, as well as what Risk each Approach mitigates.

The four Approaches are:
- Forceful
- Clever
- Sneaky
- Bold

---
### Forceful
You take a direct and straightforward approach to achieve your results. Your methods are generally unsophisticated and brutalist, and any collateral damage or side-effects from this approach are taken for granted. This Approach doesn't only apply to violence or shows of force, but also just taking the most simple and direct way to achieve your goal, regardless of the consequences.

If you take a **Forceful** Approach, you mitigate the Risk of **Ineffectiveness**, but as a Consequence you might **Waste Resources** - things break, people take notice, you take longer than expected, etc.

### Clever
The opposite of **Forceful**. You try to achieve your goal in a smart and genius way, making sure you achieve it without any additional issues, problems or collateral damage. This Approach applies to most forms of quick-thinking, detailed strategies, and anything where you account for all other factors and choose the optimal course of action.

If you take a **Clever** Approach, you mitigate the Risk of **Wasting Resources**, but as a Consequence you might be **Ineffective**- you take too long, it's too complicated to execute, other elements start changing, etc.

### Sneaky
You make sure you achieve your goal without anyone knowing it was you, or what your true intent is. This can be through misdirection, deceit, or simply nobody even knowing that you were there. This Approach applies to stealth, deception, and subterfuge, where the optimal outcome is no one realizing you even did anything.

If you take a **Sneaky** Approach, you mitigate the Risk of **Revealing Things**, but as a Consequence you might cause **Confusion** - people get the wrong idea, coordination breaks down, etc.

### Bold
The opposite of **Sneaky**. You achieve your goal with outward exuberance, charisma and performance. A Bold Approach leans on being seen and being flashy. You invoke the help or awe of others to aid you in your goals, or you make your presence undeniable. This Approach applies to diplomacy, charms, or simply grand displays of ability and performance.

If you take a **Bold** Approach, you mitigate the Risk of **Confusion**, but as a Consequence you might **Reveal Things** - your true intentions or hidden agendas may be inconveniently revealed.

## Aptitudes
Although the Metaverse fulfills a great role in society and humanity, at its core it is a digital environment. As your Hacker, you have a wealth of experience in computer related skills that help you navigate the Metaverse. Depending on how you've used your computer in the past, you have built up experience in 4 different **Aptitudes**.

Whenever your Hacker performs an action through their Avatar, a specific Aptitude most applies to what you're attempting to do.

The four Aptitudes are:
- **Kinetics**
- **Analysis**
- **Influence**
- **Mechanics**

---
### Kinetics
Aptitude in Kinetics means you're used to controlling avatars in one way or another. Maybe you've played a lot of platformers or fighting games such as **Super Mario Bros**, **Ray Man** or **Metal Gear Solid**. You are well versed in controlling your Metaverse Avatar's bodily skills: jumping, climbing, sneaking, fighting, et cetera.

You use the Kinetics Aptitude when your Avatar does anything 'physical' with their 'body'.

### Analysis
Aptitude in Analysis means you're used to analysing data that's presented to you. Maybe you have a great career in Big Data, or you spend all your free time in Excel spreadsheets or point-and-click puzzle games such as **Myst**. You are well versed in spotting details on your screen, logical reasoning, problem-solving and deduction.

You use the Analysis Aptitude to perceive what the Metaverse presents to you, or when you try and understand how another player might be feeling.

### Influence
Aptitude in Influence means you're unusually socially capable for a Hacker. Maybe you manage the IT department in a company, or maybe you work at a helpdesk, or maybe you play a lot of multiplayer games like **Everquest**, **Unreal Tournament** or **Call of Duty**. You are well versed in getting someone else on your side, or getting them to do something for you.

You use the Influence Aptitude whenever you interact socially with other players or NPCs.

### Mechanics
Aptitude in Mechanics means you're experienced in fiddling around with hardware and like making sure everything fits on a detailed level. Maybe you repair computers for a living, or maybe you make sure every computer has an optimal software package. If you play videogames, you like to use external devices such as controllers, steering wheels or light guns.  You are well versed in understanding, handling, controlling and fiddling with components - either hard- or software.

You use the Mechanics Aptitude whenever you interact with an object in the Metaverse, such as picking a lock, driving a car, firing a gun, et cetera.

# Action Resolution
Every Action Resolution starts with the player stating:
- What they want to achieve (the **Intention**)
- How they want to achieve is (the **Method**)

From these two parameters, the GM sets a **Difficulty** for the action and suggests the appropriate **Approach** and **Aptitude**. The player can argue for a different combination, but ultimately the GM decides what is allowed.

## Difficulties
Based on what you attempt to do, the GM assigns a Difficulty to your action.
- A **Regular Difficulty** is the default difficulty. This is something that can reasonably be achieved by anyone with basic training or talent.
- A **Hard Difficulty** is for harder challenges, where specific expertise or skill is required to have a reasonable chance of success.
- An **Extreme Difficulty** is reserved for those one-in-a-million shots. This is something that even a master in the field might have difficulty achieving.


## The Action Roll
Once the Approach and Aptitude are determined and the **Difficulty** is set, it's time to resolve the **Action Roll**. To make an Action Roll, you roll a number of d6 equal to the cumulative score of the appropriate Approach and Aptitude. Some situations might give you a bonus or a penalty to your Action Roll. This is designated in the text as **Take +#d** or **Take -#d**. The # tells you how many dice you add or subtract from your pool. Generally dice pools will range from 0d6 to 6d6 - where 0d6 means you roll two dice but only use the one with the lowest number rolled.

After you've rolled the dice, you count the dice that came up with a **5 or 6**. Each one of these dice counts as a **Success**. Compare the amount of **Success** to the **Difficulty** to determine the outcome:
- Actions of a **Regular Difficulty** require **1 Success** to succeed.
- Actions of a **Hard Difficulty** require **2 Successes** to succeed.
- Actions of an **Extreme Difficulty** require **3 Successes** to succeed.

If you don't have the exact amount of **Success** required for your action, refer to the following possibilities:
- If you didn't roll a single **Success**, your action is a **Fail**: either you don't achieve what you want, or you achieve it at a major cost. The consequence of the Fail is based on the Approach you used - you fail to mitigate the **Risk** associated with your Approach.
- If you have at least **1 Success**, but not enough to succeed (so only **1 Success** for a **Hard Difficulty** or **1 or 2 Successes** for an **Extreme Difficulty**), you get a **Partial Success**. You achieve what you wanted, but there is a complication or cost involved. These complications or costs are related to the Approach you used - you suffer the **Consequence** of your Approach.
- If you have **more Successes** than required for the task, you get a **Critical Success**: everything works out amazingly and you get more than you expected.

### Action Roll Probabilities
Refer to the below table for the probabilities of Successes for different size dice pools.

| Dice pool | Failure | 1 Success | 2 Success | 3+ Success |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 0d6       | 89%     | 11%       | -         | -          |
| 1d6       | 67%     | 33%       | -         | -          |
| 2d6       | 44%     | 44%       | 11%       | -          |
| 3d6       | 30%     | 44%       | 22%       | 4%         |
| 4d6       | 20%     | 40%       | 30%       | 11%        |
| 5d6       | 13%     | 33%       | 33%       | 21%        |
| 6d6       | 9%      | 26%       | 33%       | 32%        |

# System Stress
Computer is life. Everything you do, see, hear and experience in the Metaverse goes through your computer. All of this fiddling in the Metaverse requires a lot of processing power from your system. Doing too much brings you in danger of overheating your computer, causing it to shut down.

## Stress and your CPU
**System Stress** represent the strain you put on your computer. It's accrued by a number of things, such as avoiding Avatar death, hacking the Metaverse, or overclocking your CPU. Your computer has a limited capacity of taking this Stress, which is represented by your **CPU Heat Track**. When you take System Stress, your CPU Heat Track gets filled up. When this Track is fully filled, your capacity for taking System Stress is gone. Any additional System Stress causes your computer to freeze and shut down. This means you have to wait for your CPU to cool down before you can reboot, and you might have to deal with your angry parents who demand to know why the power went out in the house. For the remainder of the current scene in the game, you're out. When the scene in which you overheated concludes and a new scene starts, you have managed to log back in and join your friends with an empty Heat track.

Your **CPU Heat Track** is capable of taking **5 System Stress**.


## Taking Stress
There are several ways you can accrue **System Stress**:

- *Overclocking*: Sometimes you really need a win. By **Overclocking your CPU** you can gain an edge on an Action Roll you're about to make. If you declare you're going to Overclock, you **Take +1d** on the roll but you also take **1 System Stress**.

- *Game Over*: In order to simulate reality and to discourage PvP in the Metaverse, your Avatar only has one life. As soon as something happens to your Avatar that damages it - falling from a great height, getting hit by a car, take a hit from a knife or a gun - it's game over. This means your Avatar respawns at the nearest hub - you'll have to spend time to get back to where you died. You can avoid this Avatar death by quickly hacking into the Metaverse. By taking **1 Stress**, you can glitch out of harm's way and avoid Avatar death.

- *Let Me Altavista That*: Sometimes you're stuck no knowing what to do. The internet can help! By loading up Netscape and surfing to Altavista, you can quickly find an answer to question. Opening your browser alongside the Metaverse will tax your system though, so you'll have to take **1 System Stress**. If you do so, phrase a question that you would type into a search engine. The GM will give you the answer, or otherwise a useful piece of advice regarding your question.


## Reducing Stress
There are several ways to reduce your **System Stress**.

- *Taking it Easy*: You reduce your **System Stress** by 1 after every scene in which you haven't accrued any.

- *Voluntary Lag*: You can reduce the processing speed of your computer to reduce System Stress. Whenever you make an Action Roll, you can choose to **Take -1d** on the roll to reduce System Stress by 1. You can do this multiple times on the same roll, but you can't reduce your roll below 0d6.

- *LAN Party*: Through the world wide web, you can grant an ally access to your CPU. They can reduce their System Stress, but you increase yours by the same amount.

- *Hack the Mainframe*: Once per game session, you can hack into the Metaverse mainframe to 'borrow' processing power. This reduces your System Stress by 3.

# Hacking
As a Hacker, you're not limited to the Metaverse and your Avatar. With your specialized skills and experience, you're capable of hacking directly into the Metaverse to change it to your liking. 

When your Hacker hacks the Metaverse, you're going 'behind the scenes' into the source code of the Metaverse. You can do several things while hacking the Metaverse:

- *Search for information (Clever, Sneaky)*: Search the logs to find out who else visited a location, sneak a peek at private messages between players, trace bank account details from Avatars to their players.

- *Change the environment (Bold, Forceful)*: You can recode locations in order to alter their appearance, qualities and lay-out.

- *Change appearance (Sneaky)*: You can recode your Avatar to temporarily change their appearance.

- *Locate IP (Clever)*: You can track a player's IP to their Avatar's current Metaverse location.

- *Create items (Bold)*: Create temporary weapons, tools, vehicles or other objects your Avatar can use.

- *Bypass Firewall (Forceful)*: Bypass a firewall and load your Avatar into a locked, known location.

You don't have to roll for a Hack. If you pay the cost, you get the effect. The GM has the final say in to what extent a Hack is possible.


## The Cost of Hacking
Hacking the Metaverse severely taxes your computer system. Performing a Hack has a base cost of **3 System Stress**. However, because you're an experienced hacker, there are ways to reduce the cost. Each type of Hacking has associated Approaches. When you perform such a Hack, you reduce the **System Stress** for that hack by your score in that Approach.

For example: you want to create a sports car. *Create Items* is associated with the **Bold** Approach. If your score in Bold is 2, you subtract this number from the base cost of **3 System Stress**. You can perform this Hack by taking **1 System Stress**.

# H4XX0R G34R
Each Hacker gets to choose 1 specialized piece of hardware of the following list:

 - **NEC Multisync A500 24" CRT Curved Monitor**: You have the finest of high-end CRT monitors, allowing you to see the Metaverse in intricate detail. **Take +1d** on every **Analysis** roll.
- **IBM Model 'M' Triple-Deck Keyboard**: With your specialized keyboard - that takes up most of your desk - you can keybind every thing imaginable. For you, movement is not limited by WASD but by WASD€»¬´¶«¿~! **Take +1d** on every **Kinetics** roll.
- **Micropoint Titanium Three-Button Performance Mouse**: You have equiped your high-end mouse with an incredibly smooth and sensitive titanium ball, giving you ultimate precision on where you direct your pointer. **Take +1d** on every **Mechanics** roll.

- **+4 MB RAM**: You have outfitted your system with a plethora of working memory, allowing you to handle extreme strains of data! Increase your total **System Stress** by **2**.
- **Pentium 3 420MHz CPU**: Your processing speed is out of this world. Twice per game session, you can **Overclock** without taking Stress.
- **Experimental HyperCO2oler**: You have built an experimental cooling system that hooks up to a CO2 tank and the water supply of your town. Once per session, you can activate your experimental cooling system: roll 1d6 and reduce your System Stress by the amount rolled. 
- **128kbps Dial-up**: By stacking two 56kbps modems on top of each other you've somehow more than doubled your connection speed! As your lag nears zero, you can **act first** in any tense situation and you **Take +1d** on your first Action Roll in such a situation.
- **Hacking Submodule**: By attaching a separate module to your PC to handle your hacking, you free up system space for other activities. Choose one type of Hacking: the Stress cost for any hacking of this type is reduced by 1 (minimum 1).
