# What is Liminal Horror
Liminal Horror is a game in the NSR (New School Revolution) genre: a genre that focuses on games where the character's background and circumstances are important to the game, the rules are light and secondary to the fiction, and players are required to solve problems with clever thinking rather than looking at their character sheet to see which ability will solve it for them. Liminal Horror's rules are based off Into the Odd. Other games that are based on Into the Odd are Cairn and Electric/Mythic Bastionland.

# What is on the Character Sheet
### Ability Scores
There are three ability scores: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Control (CTRL). Each is ranked between 3 and 18, and you determine your starting score by rolling 3d6. Whenever you perform a risky action, you roll a Save for the appropriate ability score: Strength for actions that require force, brawn, or that test your vitality. Dexterity for actions that require speed, finesse, and accuracy. Control for actions that require willpower, charisma, and mental stability.

During play, your Ability Scores may **decrease**, lowering your chance of successful Saves. When an ability score reaches 0, you're either dead (STR), paralyzed (DEX), or mentally broken (CTRL).

### Hit Protection
HP stands for Hit **Protection**, not Hit **Points**. HP represents your ability and capacity to **avoid** actual harm. When you take a physical or mental hit, damage gets deducted from HP first. If this doesn't bring your HP to 0, you've not taken any actual wounds.

You determine your max HP by rolling 1d6. HP is recovered quickly: a brief rest restores your HP back to full.

### Inventory
Your Inventory is a key aspect of the game. The items you carry define the actions you can take. Everyone has 10 Inventory Slots. 1 Slot for each hand, 2 Slots on your body, and 6 Slots in a bag or rucksack. Items in your hands or on your body are readily available for use, items in your rucksack are not. 

You can carry a reasonable number of items beyond your Inventory Slots, but you're **Deprived** if you do so.

Items come in 3 varieties:
- Normal items occupy 1 slot
- Bulky items occupy 2 slots
- Petty items occupy no slots, but a bunch of them can be bundled to occupy 1 slot

##### Fatigue
Certain aspects of the game can cause you to become Fatigued. Fatigue is a condition that takes up 1 Inventory Slot. You can't use that Slot for carrying items, and if you have to take Fatigue when you're at full Inventory, you have to drop something. Fatigue stacks, occupying another Slot for each addition.

### Armor and Stability
**Armor** represents physical gear that blocks damage from incoming attacks. When you get attacked, you deduct your Armor score from the damage before applying it to your HP.

**Stability** represents mental warding that lowers stress and mental strain. When you have to take Stress, you deduct your Stability score before applying it to your HP.

# The Rules of the Game
The rules of Liminal Horror are straightforward. The GM describes the environment and your situation, and the player character react to it. Characters can do anything they can be reasonably assumed to be capable of. There are no rolls to see if you can do an activity, only rolls to avoid harm when you do risky things.

There are no Knowledge- or Perception-type rolls. The GM gives any information a character would likely know/see with regards to their background or situation. Neither are there Persuasion-type rolls: you interact with an NPC as you would with a normal person, and they react according to their personality/motivations/beliefs.


---
### Saves
The main roll in the game is the Save. You make a Save **to avoid risk or harm**. If you take an action that doesn't have any risk involved, you don't need to roll a Save - you can just do it. Saves are made against one of the three ability scores: STR, DEX, or CTRL.

If it's unclear if an action is risky enough to warrant a Save, the GM can check three factors: **Time**, **Gear**, and **Skill**. 
- If you have zero or one, you can't do it
- If you have all three, you can do it
- If you have two, you can probably do it but you need to roll a Save to avoid a negative outcome

For example: you want to climb a 3 meter tall wall.
- You have Time if there's no rush and no restraints on the amount of attempts you can make
- You have Gear if you have a rope or some other tool to help you scale the wall
- You have Skill if your character is someone who would be athletic and strong enough to climb the wall properly

If you have to roll a Save, you roll a d20 and compare the result to the relevant ability score. If the result is equal to or lower than your ability score, you succeed. If it's greater than your ability score, you fail.

If two sides are in a contest, the individual that is **most at risk as a result of failure** has to make the Save.


---
### Conditions
There are a two Conditions of note that influence your character.

- **Fatigue** can be gained in various ways, as a result of the narrative or of failed Saves on strenuous activities. Each instance of Fatigue occupies one Inventory Slot. A full night's rest removes one Fatigue.
- **Deprived** is gained from being deprived of sufficient food, drink, and rest. When you're Deprived, you can't recover HP or Ability Score Damage. If you're Deprived for more than 24 hours, you gain one instance of Fatigue for every day you're Deprived thereafter.

### Combat
Combat in Liminal Horror is fast and dangerous. Any good hit could (mortally) wound you, so you have to choose your fights carefully.

##### Initiative
Combat turns get taken by side, where every character on one team can take their actions simultaneously. When combat starts, the turns are resolved as follows:
1. Every player character makes a DEX Save.
2. Those who succeeded on the DEX Save get to take their turn before the enemies.
3. After these characters have taken their turn, all enemies take their turn.
4. Afterwards, all player characters take their turn, followed by the enemies, et cetera.

If one side surprises the other, that side always gets to go first.

##### Your Turn
Whenever you have your turn, you can:
- Move 40'
- Take an Action (attacking, making a maneuver, switching At Hand/Body items with Pack items, move further, et cetera).
Everyone who acts on the same turn declares their actions **before** rolling any dice to resolve them. Resolution happens simultaneously.

##### Attacking
There are no to-hit rolls in Liminal Horror, and there are no misses: only varying levels of effect. When you attack, roll the weapon die associated with the weapon and apply that number to your opponent. Weapon dice range from d4 (for unarmed attacks) to d10 (for specialized weapons).

If more than one attacker targets the same opponent, roll all weapon dice and keep the single highest value.
If you attack with dual weapons at the same time, roll both weapon dice and keep the single highest value. 

There are a few modifiers that affect your attack:
- **Impaired**: If you make an attack from a position of weakness or disadvantage, your attack is Impaired. You always roll a d4 for an Impaired attack, regardless of the weapon you use.
- **Enhanced**: If you make an attack from a position of advantage or power, your attack is Enhanced. You always roll a d12 for an Enhanced attack.
- **+dx**: If there are two weapon dice noted with a + sign (like d6+d4, or d10+d10), roll all indicated dice and keep the single highest value.
- **Blast**: Some weapons have the Blast tag. This means that an attack hits everything in a target area, rolling the weapon die separately for each affected individual.
- **Non-lethal**: Non-lethal weapons can never kill, but they can disable.

##### Taking Damage
If you get hit with an attack, you deduct the result of your weapon die from your HP first. If this brings your HP below zero, any excess damage is reduced from your STR score. This represents actual physical harm that you take. 

As soon as you take STR damage, you roll a STR Save using your new score. If you fail this Save, you take a **Wound**. A Wound is an injury that - depending on the severity - will hinder or impair your character going forward. A Wound also occupies an Inventory Slot, like Fatigue. If you survive this scene, roll on the Wounds table to see what effect this experience had on you.
If an attack reduces your STR to 0, you die.


| STR Lost | Wound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3      | Tis but a flesh wound. After it's been bandaged up, remove the Wound from your Inventory and roll 1d6: if the result is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4-5      | You have a minor injury, such as sprained extremity, a deep cut, or a shot wound in a non-fatal area. You need proper medical attention and a day's rest. Afterwards, remove the Wound from your Inventory. Then roll 1d6 and add the result to your max HP                                                                                                                               |
| 6-7      | You have a lasting injury, such as a broken hand/foot, a stab wound, or a shot wound with the bullet still inside. You can barely move and act until you've received medical attention. When you do, roll 2d6: if the result is higher than your max HP, take the new result. You only recover the Wound after a week.                                                                    |
| 8-9      | You receive a major wound, like a severed limb or a major arterial bleed. You die unless you receive medical attention within the hour. When you do, you come out stronger. Roll 3d6: if the result is higher than your STR, take the new result. You only recover the Wound after a week in a peaceful environment with dedicated medical attention.                                     |
| 10+      | By rights you should be dead, but somehow you're pulling through. You immediately fall unconscious and remain so for 24 hours, after which you wake up if you've received proper medical attention. If the next Save you make for a Wound is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6: if the result is higher than your max HP, take the new result. You never recover the Wound. |


Non-lethal weapons target DEX instead of STR after depleting HP. You can't take Wounds from non-lethal weapons, and if your DEX is reduced to 0 you are not dead - just unable to move or act.

**Note**: Only damage you take from attacks gets funneled through your HP first. If you take damage from falling from a great height or an explosion the damage is applied directly to your STR, triggering a Save against Wounds.

##### Healing
Taking a quick rest for a few moments in a safe location restores all HP.
Ability score damage and Wounds recover slower, requiring rest, time, and medical attention.

##### Fleeing
You can flee from a combat on your side's turn if:
- You have a safe place to flee to
- You succeed on a DEX Save

### Stress and Fallout
Stress is a metaphysical analogue to damage, and it represents how horror and terror affect your character. Stress functions identical to physical damage taken in combat, with the exception that it reduces your CTRL after your HP is depleted, instead of STR.

When Stress reduces your CTRL, you immediately make a CTRL Save using the new score. On a fail, you are paralyzed with fear while whatever freaked you out is still around. If you survive this scene, roll on the Fallout table to see what effect this experience had on you.


| CTRL Lost | Fallout                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3       | You are rattled and shaken, making you more wary for the future. Roll 1d6: if it's higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 4-5       | The shock causes you to focus on little else than survival. You're **Deprived** until you rest in a safe location for a few hours. Afterwards, rolls 1d6 and add the number to your max HP.                                                                                                        |
| 6-7       | You've dropped all your items when you fled, but this experience has hardened your mind. Gain +1 Stability (Max 3).                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8-9       | Your experience has caused you to become increasingly paranoid of your allies. Until they manage to keep you calm for a day and convince you otherwise, you don't trust them anymore. When you are sufficiently calmed down, roll 3d6: if it's higher than your current CTRL, take the new result. |
| 10+       | Your mind is shattered, but you're still hanging on by a thread. If your next Save against Fallout is a fail, you go permanently insane. However, if you pass you've gained an unnatural insight in the world: roll 1d6 and add the result to your CTRL.                                           |

# Whisper Cards
Whisper Cards are a mechanic to push characters to action. Whisper Cards can be gained by individual players from different actions and situations, such as gaining Fallout, encountering the horrible and terrible, or some failed Saves. When you take a Whisper Card, keep it secret from both the other players and the GM. 

Each Whisper Card has two prompts. Choose one and act on it in the subsequent scenes. Some Whisper Cards might detail a more terrible fate that has befallen your character. Incorporate it, but keep the contents of the Whisper Card hidden until the end of the game!


---
# Voidcrawling
Whenever your character or group moves through the horrible environment, unexpected events can happen. The procedure that is used to guide exploration and events is called the **Voidcrawling Procedure**. Each Voidcrawling Procedure consists of one or more Voidcrawl Cycles:

1. The GM describes the environment and rehashes the current situation, giving any pertinent information that is immediately noticeable to the characters.
2. The players each declare which (one) action their characters will take during the cycle. Examples of common actions are:
    - Moving to a different area
    - Searching an area (particularly large locations might require you to state a specific area to search)
    - Keeping an eye out for dangers to avoid being surprised by anything unexpected
    - Overcome an obstacle in your way such as a locked door or blocking debris
3. Everyones' actions resolve simultaneously
4. The GM determines whether to roll the Encounter Die, and resolves the outcome.
5. Any resources are checked against their duration, the GM's tools and tables are updated, and the Cycle repeats.

---
### Encounter Die
The Encounter Die is a d6 that gets rolled by the GM to determine what unexpected event, if any, befalls the characters. Triggers for the GM to roll the Encounter Die can be:
- When the group stays in the same (unsafe) location for more than one Cycle
- When the group takes a rest in an unsafe location
- When the group travels to a different or new location
- When the group does something that could attract unwanted attention
- When the group does something reckless

The Encounter Die outcomes are as follows:

| d6  | Outcome     | Explanation                                                                                                                |
| --- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter   | The group is presented with a Wandering Encounter.                                                                         |
| 2   | Sign        | The group finds a clue or sign to someone - or something - nearby.                                                         |
| 3   | Environment | The environment shifts. Passages may be blocked, new factions may arrive, or a resource becomes sparse..                   |
| 4   | Loss        | Something breaks, fails, or otherwise becomes unusable.                                                                    |
| 5   | Exhaustion  | Everyone gets tired, hungry, and thirsty. The group has to choose to rest for a Cycle, consume a ration, or add a Fatigue. |
| 6   | Quiet       | You're safe and left alone... for now...                                                                                   |
