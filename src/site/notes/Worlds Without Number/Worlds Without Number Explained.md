Worlds Without Number is an Old School Renaissance (OSR) game by Kevin Crawford. It's the fantasy adventure version of his earlier scifi game Stars Without Number. Recently he also released a cyberpunk version: Cities Without Number.

Hallmarks of OSR games is that the rules are generally easy to pick up, and that it's less heroic than high fantasy adventures like D&D. The focus is more on the players being people in a dangerous world trying to make their way through life, delving dungeons for treasures. The player characters are capable people, but no superheroes. A sprung trap or an unfortunate hostile encounter can very easily end your character's life, and the style emphasises using your smarts to overcome obstacles and avoid fights if you can.

"*The answer is found in the game world, not on your character sheet*."

# Your Characters
Character generation is fairly straightforward, and unlike most OSR games WWN actually has quite a lot of player options to diversify the characters.

A character consists of the following features:
- 6 attributes: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS and CHA, with modifiers ranging from -2 to +2
- A **Background** that signifies what you have done in life before your adventuring started
- **Skills** that determine what things you're good at
- Your **Class**, which represents your adventuring talents
- One or more **Foci**: side talents or particular specialisations of your adventurer (think Feats)

If you want to build your own character, check out the Character Creation rules in the free version of WWN: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348809/worlds-without-number-free-edition
I will provide a few pregenerated characters for play for people who want them.

## Attributes
The classic 6 attributes are used in WWN, and they range from 3 to 18.
If you make your own character, you roll 3d6 six times and assign them however you want, and you can change one of them to 14.

Attribute Modifiers are calculated differently than in D&D:

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 3     | -2       |
| 4-7   | -1       |
| 8-13  | +0       |
| 14-17 | +1       |
| 18    | +2       |

---
## Background
There are a number of Backgrounds to choose from. Each background gives you Level-0 proficiency in one particular Skill (more on that later). You can then either choose between some other Skills or roll on a specified table to determine what other proficiencies you have.

---
## Skills
Skills represent your proficiency in certain tasks or actions. While most of the time a character can attempt a skill without any proficiency in it, it's way easier to get a success if you have some proficiency.

Skill proficiency starts at Level-0 and goes up to Level-4. A Level-0 proficiency reflects that you have an ordinary competence in it that could be expected from a common practioner, whereas a Level-4 proficiency reflects that you're among the best in the world. Skills are usually noted as the skill's name followed by your level in it, such as Exert-0 or Shoot-2.

The Skills range from Administer (keeping an organization running, analyzing records and archives) to Sailing. 
Three of the skills are **Combat Skills**: Punch, Stab and Shoot. You use these skill proficiencies for your Hit rolls when attacking.

---
## Classes
There are 4 main classes in WWN:

**Warrior**: The Warrior is a combat-focused character who is good with weapons. Warriors have the most Hit Points of all the classes and the highest Attack Bonus. They also have a feature that allows them to once per scene change a missed attack into a hit, or a hit into a miss.

**Mage**: The Mage is a magic user. There are several different magic traditions to choose from, each with some other features. Mages have the lowest Hit Points and the lowest Attack Bonus of the classes.

**Expert**: The Expert is someone who is well-skilled. They have middling Hit Points and Attack Bonus, but get the most skill points. They can also, once per scene, reroll a failed non-combat skill check.

**Adventurer**: The Adventurer is a collection of half-classes. If you are an Adventurer, you combine two of the above main classes and get partial features from both. So you can be a Warrior-Mage, Mage-Expert, Warrior-Expert, or even Mage-Mage by selecting different magic traditions.

---
## Foci
A Focus is a special talent your character has developed. Each Focus comes in 2 levels, and you need to have picked up the first level before you can pick up the second level. Many Foci give a bonus skill proficiency as well some other benefit.


---
# How the Game Works
The game works on the basic framework:
- The GM describes the environment
- The Players describe what their characters do, possibly rolling dice
- The GM adjudicates the outcomes and describes the effect

The game uses three different resolution systems: **Skill Checks**, **Saving Throws** and **Combat**.
Then we will touch on **Injuries and Healing**, **Magic**, and finally concluding with **Equipment and Encumbrance**.

---
## Skill Checks
If you make a Skill Check, the GM will tell you what Skill to use and what Attribute goes along with it. You might be called for a Str/Exert check to see if you can lift a heavy boulder, or a Wis/Sneak check to see if you remain hidden while sneaking through a castle.

If you make a Skill Check, you roll **2d6**, add your **Attribute Modifier** and your **Skill Level**. If you don't have any proficiency (so not even a Level-0) in the Skill, you get a -1 penalty instead.

The DC for Skill Checks range from 6 to 14, with 8 being the standard difficulty. 

You can aid a party member in a Skill to give them a +1 bonus to their roll. To do this, you need to make your own Skill Check first (this doesn't need to be the Skill that you're aiding on, it depends on how you want to aid). The DC of this aiding check also depends on what you're trying to do. Multiple people can try to aid, but the acting PC doesn't ever get more than a +1 total bonus.

---
## Saving Throws
Your character makes a Saving Throw if they need to avoid a harmful effect. When you make a Saving Throw, you roll a **d20** and try to roll **equal to or higher** than the relevant Saving Throw score. There are four Saving Throws:

**Evasion saves** are made to dodge peril, take cover, or anything else that requires nimbleness and speed. 
You calculate your **Evasion save** as: 16 - your PC's level - your Dex or Int modifier, whichever is highest.

**Mental saves** are made to resist mind-affecting magic, disbelieve illusions or other tests of willpower. 
You calculate your **Mental save** as: 16 - your PC's level - your Wis or Cha modifier, whichever is highest.

**Physical saves** are made to resist poisons, diseases, exhausation or other bodily trials. 
You calculate your **Physical save** as: 16 - your PC's level - your Str or Con modifier, whichever is highest.

**Luck saves** are made in situations where only luck can save your from disaster. 
You calculate your **Luck save** as: 16 - your PC's level.

---
## Combat
Combat follows the known structure of rounds and turns. Each round takes around 10 seconds.

### Initiative
Initiative is rolled **per side** in combat. Each side rolles **1d8** and adds the highest Dex modifier from their group, where any ties are won by the PCs. The side that gets highest gets to go first, in whatever order their members choose. After that the other side goes, and so on.
If one side surprises the other, they all get a full round to act before Initiative is rolled.

### Actions in Combat
There are 4 different types of actions to take in Combat:
- **Main Actions** take up most of your round, and you can only take one Main Action per round. Main Actions can be attacking, casting a spell, applying first aid, et cetera.
- **Move Actions** involve moving up to your speed. You can take a second Move Action by sacrificing your Main Action. You need to use your movement in one go, you can't split it up around a Main Action.
- **On Turn Actions** are minor, quick actions you take on your turn that only take a small time to perform, such as falling prone, talking, reloading a bow or drawing a readied weapon. You can take as many On Turn Actions as the GM thinks reasonable.
- **Instant Actions** are so fast and simple that you can take them at any time, even when it's not your turn. There's no limit to the number of Instant Actions you can take.

##### Common Actions
###### Main Actions
- **Melee attack**: Swing a Readied weapon to attack your opponent.
- **Ranged attack**: Fire a Readied bow or crossbow at a target in range. You can't make a Ranged attack with a two-handed ranged weapon if you're within melee range of an opponent. In this situation you can still make a Ranged attack with a one-handed ranged weapon or thrown weapon, but at a -4 penalty.
- **Swarm attack**: When you make a Swarm attack, you and your allies gang up on a single target. Each assailant takes this action against a target in range of their current weapon, until up to 4 have done so. When the final participant makes a Swarm attack, one of the mob is elected to make a melee or ranged attack against the target. They gain a +2 to Hit and +1 to Damage for each other participant, up to +6/+3. This bonus damage does not add to Shock Damage, and it can't bring the total damage over the maximum usually possible for the blow. However, Shock damage is always inflicted, even if the target has a too-high AC or other Shock immunity.
- **Cast a spell**: A magic user can cast a spell as a Main Action. However, if you've taken Hit Point damage this round, or you've drawn or sheathed a weapon with your spellcasting hand, you can't take this action. If someone attacks you when you cast, the magic sizzles and the spell slot is wasted.
- **Shatter a Shield**: To Shatter a target's shield, you must use a crushing or hewing weapon such as a Mace or Axe. After a successful Hit roll, the attacker makes a Str/Stab skill check against the opponent. The DC of this check is 8 + the target's Stab skill + the target's Str score (according to the rules it's an opposed roll, but I don't like opposed rolls). If the attacker succeeds, the Shield is broken.
- **Make a Fighting Withdrawal**: You disengage from any melee foes around you, so you can safely withdraw (using your Move Action) without provoking free attacks.
- **Use a Skill**: You make a skill check for something that is plausably achievable in a round, such as a Heal check.
- **Ready or Stow an Item**: You draw a stowed weapon or retrieve something from your backpack, or the other way around.
- **Reload a weapon**: You reload a cumbersome weapon like a crossbow or other projectile launcher. Bows can be reloaded as an On Turn action with a Shoot-1 skill, otherwise it's a Move Action.
- **Charge**: You can move up to twice your speed in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack with a +2 to hit. You must have moved at least 10 ft. and you get a -2 penalty to AC for the rest of the round. This takes both your Main Action and Move Action.

###### Move Actions
- **Run**: Move up to your speed (30 ft., or one zone if using zones). Climbing or swimming halves the distance you can move and may require an Exert Skill check.
- **Screen an Ally**: You move up to an ally and physically block opponents from attacking them, as long as they remain within 10 ft. Until your next turn, enemies who wish to attack (melee or ranged) your ally must succeed in an appropriate Str or Dex Combat Skill check against a DC of 7 + your Attribute and Skill modifier applicable to your weapon. If they fail, the attack roll is directed towards your instead. You can screen against a number of attacks equal to your relevant Skill Level. So with a Stab-2 you can redirect up to 2 attacks per round. This also means you can't effectively screen an ally if you only have a Level-0 proficiency. Multiple PCs can screen the same ally.
- **Pick up an Item**: Pick up an item on the ground in a free hand, and you have it Readied
- **Stand Up**: Stand up from a Prone position.
- **Hold an Action**: You can delay taking the rest of your available actions later in the round, activating them as an Instant Action whenever you want. 
- **Charge**: You can move up to twice your speed in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack with a +2 to hit. You must have moved at least 10 ft. and you get a -2 penalty to AC for the rest of the round. This takes both your Main Action and Move Action.

###### On Turn Actions
- **Fall Prone**: You fall prone, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a -2 penalty to hit you. Adjacent melee attackers get a +2 bonus to hit, though.
- **Delay an Action**: You delay the remainder of your actions this turn until after a particular other participant has acted, such as might be needed for a tactical plan. Unlike **Hold an Action**, you can't take your actions at any point you want. You must wait until the participant you've chosen to act after has taken their turn. 
- **Switch Readied Weapons**: You can switch one Readied weapon out for another.
- **Reload a weapon**: You can reload projectile weapons like a bow or a sling as an On Turn action, provided that you have at least Shoot-1 and a Readied quiver. Otherwise it's a Move Action.

###### Instant Actions
- **Snap Attack**: If you have a Readied weapon, you can rush your attack sacrificing accuracy for speed. You still need to have your Main Action impending or available this round, and as an Instant Action you sacrifice that Main Action to make an immediate melee or ranged attack. This comes with a -4 penalty to hit. 
- **Total Defense**: You can choose to throw everything in defending yourself. You still need to have your Main Action impending or available this round, and as an Instant Action you sacrifice that Main Action to get a +2 to AC until your next turn, and you get immunity to Shock damage (including from Swarm Attacks).
- **Drop an Item**: You drop an item to the ground, freeing up a hand.

---
### Attack an enemy
When you attack an enemy, you first make a Hit roll.
When you make a Hit roll, you roll a **d20** and add:
- Your relevant Combat Skill level (Punch, Stab or Shoot). If you don't have any proficiency in the relevant Combat Skill, you take a -2 penalty instead.
- Your class's Attack Bonus
- The relevant Attribute Modifier (usually Str or Dex).

Depending on the situation (such as cover or prone targets), other bonuses or penalties might imply. These generally range from -4 to +4.

The result is compared to the target's AC. If it equals or exceeds the AC, you score a hit and deal damage. If you don't score a hit, you might still deal **Shock damage**.

---
### Dealing Damage
To roll damage, you roll your weapon's damage die and add your relevant Attribute Modifier. If you have any bonuses from a Focus or other effects, you also add that.

Some weapons can deal **Shock damage**. This means that even on a less-than-perfect attack, you still deal some damage to your opponent. Shock damage is listed on the weapon's attribute with points of damage and below which AC it applies (as highly armored opponents can negate the shock damage). For example "Shock 2/AC 15" means that if you miss your Attack roll and the target has an AC of 15 or lower, you still deal 2 damage. You also add your relevant Attribute Modifier to the Shock damage and other special effects that specifically note that it adds to Shock damage.

Shock damage also acts as a bottom floor of your damage output. If your Shock damage would be 4, but a succesfull Attack roll results in 3 points of damage, you deal 4 damage instead.

---
### Dual Wielding
If you have at least Stab-1, you can choose to dual wield with two one-handed weapons. Doing so gives you a -1 to Attack, but +2 to damage (but not Shock damage).

---
### Execution Attack
A target that is completely unaware or danger is vulnerable to an Execution Attack, which, if successful, instantly slays them.
In order to make an Execution Attack, you need a full minute of preparation (lining up a shot, stealthing up to the target, etc). Your preparation might require a Skill check. 

Once the preparation is complete, you use a Main Action to make your attack. Melee Execution Attacks always succeed, Ranged Execution Attacks require a Dex/Shoot check with a DC between 6 and 10, depending on the distance. If the Execution Attack hits, the target must make a Physical save with a penalty equal to your relevant Combat Skill level. If they fail, they're immediately mortally wounded. If they succeed, the attack still deals maximum damage.

The Warrior's **Veteran's Luck** ability only allows a reroll on a failed check, not grant an automatic success.

---
# Injuries and Healing
Your Hit Points represent the amount of damage you can take before you're at risk of dying.
When your Hit Points drop to 0, you become **Mortally Wounded**. When you're Mortally Wounded you're unable to do anything except lie prone and scream, writhe or fall unconscious. If you're Mortally Wounded for more than 6 rounds, you die. You also die if you take any more damage while Mortally Wounded.

## Stabilizing
You can Stabilize an ally that's Mortally Wounded by making an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal check as a Main Action. The DC for this check is 8 + the number of full rounds since the ally dropped. If you don't have appropriate medical supplies, the DC is increased by 2. Only one person can attempt to stabilize an ally per round, but others can attempt to aid or a failed check can be re-attempted the next round.

Once stabilized, the target recovers 1 Hit Point after 10 minutes of rest. They can act normally afterwards, but they are **Frail**. Being Frail means you can't heal through natural healing, and if you're reduced to 0 Hit Points while Frail you immediately die. 

You can cure being Frail by having a week of bed rest. Alternatively a healer can try to remove the Frail condition with an hour's work and a DC 10 skill check. This can only be attempted once.

## First Aid
By spending a few minutes tending an ally, a healer can cure **1d6 plus their Heal skill level** in points of damage. You get a -1 penalty on the healing if you don't have any Heal proficiency. Each application of First Aid applies 1 **System Strain**, but it can be repeated as often as their System Strain allows. 

First Aid can heal a Frail character, but not remove the Frail condition.

## Natural Healing
You recover your level in Hit Points after a good night's rest. You also lose one point of **System Strain**.
If you're Frail, you don't gain these benefits from resting.

## Magical Healing
By using magical forms of healing, a character immediately loses any Mortally Wounded or Frail conditions and can immediately rise. Magical Healing usually applies System Strain.

### System Strain
**System Strain** is a measure of how much stress your body is under, and it can be taxed by magical healing, hunger, or other privations.
Your maximum System Strain is equal to your **Constitution** score. You lose System Strain at a rate of one point per night's rest. If you're at maximum System Strain, you can't handle additional stress and get no benefit from attempted First Aid or Magical Healing. If your System Strain is at its maximum and you get deprived even further, there is a risk of dying.

---
## Magic
Magical spells are very powerful, with even the weakest spells capable of killing people or enslaving their minds. This makes the use of spells difficult to use, however. The casting of these powers takes a heavy toll on the caster's mental energy, and even the most accomplished mages can't cast more than 5 or 6 per day.

Derived from magical spells are a host of different magical techniques and quasi-spells that are referred to as Magical Arts. Magical Arts require less of the mage's energies and are more readily available to budding mages.

### Preparing and Casting Spells
To prepare a spell you must have been taught it, either from another mage or from a book. You must then transcribe the process in your spellbook to prepare the spell at a later time. 

Preparing spells takes an hour and can only be done after a good night's rest. Once they have been prepared, they remain so until replaced by others. Once a set of spells is prepared, the mage can cast them. Casting usually requires a Main Action and at least one free hand and clear and loud vocalization. A mage can cast any spell they have prepared.

Casting a spell requires concentration. If a mage has taken Hit Point damage or has been severely jostled, they can't cast a spell in the same round of combat. 

Magic Spells can't be cast while wearing armor or restrictive clothing, as they don't allow for the gesticulations needed for a successful casting.

### Magical Arts
Magical Arts are special magical techniques and abilities that are less powerful than spells, and often produce minor effects.
Each tradition of mages has their own set of Magical Arts the mage can learn. 

Magical Arts are fueled by **Effort**, which represents a mage's focus and mental prowess. Your Effort is equal to 1 + your Magic skill level + your Int or Cha modifier, whichever is highest. Partial Mages (from the Adventurer class) have one less Effort score, though always at least 1.

When you use a Magical Art, you might be required to **Commit Effort**. You spend one point of Effort to fuel the power. There are three timeframes attached to your Effort.
- **Commit Effort for the day** means you spend one point of Effort, and regain that point after a night's rest.
- **Commit Effort for the scene** means you spend one point of Effort, and regain that point at the start of the next scene.
- **Commit Effort indefinitely** means you spend one point of Effort for as long as you want, and you regain it as an Instant Action whenever you want, ending the effect of the art. If you have time to prepare, you can even keep commiting this Effort in your sleep to keep the effect going, but if you get struck down unexpectedly the effect ends.

Each tradition has a separate pool of Effort; there is Necromancer Effort and High Mage Effort and Healer Effort and so forth. An Adventurer who picks two different traditions has two different pools of Effort, neither of which can be used to fuel arts from the other.

---
## Equipment and Encumbrance
### Encumbrance
Unlike more modern TTRPGs, Encumbrance is a big deal in OSR games. Luckily the system for Encumbrance is quite easy in WWN.

Each item has an Encumbrance value. Most objects that fit in one hand have an Encumbrance of 1, but two-handed weapons or bigger items might have Encumbrances of 2, 3, or more. Small items like arrows or caltrops have their Encumbrance value in groups (20 arrows = 1 Encumbrance).

The system then makes a difference between **Readied** items and **Stowed** items.
- **Readied** items are items that you have readily available on your body, and which you can whip out immediately when needed. These include the armor you wear, weapons you carry on you, and other pieces of equipment. The maximum Encumbrance value of your **Readied** items is **half your Strength score rounded down**.
- **Stowed** items are items that you've put in your backpack or have otherwise packed up. These take time to recover should you need them. The maximum Encumbrance value of your **Stowed** items is **your Strength score**.

So a character with a Strength score of 12 can carry 6 items worth on Encumbrance as Readied items, and another 12 items worth as Stowed items.

If you carry more than your limit, your movement goes down to 20 ft. If you carry more than 2 Readied items or 4 Stowed Items over your limit, your speed further decreases to 15 ft. You can't carry more than 4 Readied items or 8 Stowed items above your limit.

---
### Armor, Shields and Weapons
#### Armor
Armor provides you with AC to protect yourself. There are categories of armor:
- **Light Armor** does not provide a lot of AC, but it's also low in Encumbrance and can be worn discretely if needed.
- **Medium Armor** generally grants more AC, but can't be worn discretely. Additionally any Sneak checks you make in Medium Armor get a penalty equal to the Encumbrance value of the armor.
- **Heavy Armor** provides a lot of AC, but is bulky and unwieldy. Any Sneak or Exert checks you make in Heavy Armor get a penalty equal to the Encumbrance value of the armor.

Armor needs to carried as a **Readied** item to grant its benefits.
You always add your Dexterity Modifier to your AC.

#### Shields
Shields can be worn alone, or in conjunction with other armor. It provides the following benefits:
- If it's carried alone or with any armor that has an AC value lower than the Shield lists, your AC is equal to the Shield AC. 
- If your armor has a higher AC than the shield, the shield increases your AC by 1.
- Carrying a Shield allows you to ignore 1 instance of Shock damage per round of combat.

Like Armor, a Shield needs to be carried as a Readied item to give its benefits.

![WWN Armor.png](/img/user/z_attachments/WWN/WWN%20Armor.png)

---

#### Weapons
Weapons need to be carried as a Readied item in order to attack with it. You either use your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the Hit roll, and the table tells you which you can use. You also add the same modifier to your damage rolls.

I personally feel that ranged attacks should be made with your Wisdom modifier, as it's about taking aim and generally perception skill checks are made with Wisdom as well.

Some weapons deal Shock damage. These weapons always inflict some damage, even on a failed Hit roll. The first number tells you how much Shock damage it deals, and the second number tells you the maximum target AC it affects. If your target has an AC above the value, the Shock damage does not apply.

![WWN Weapon Traits.png](/img/user/z_attachments/WWN/WWN%20Weapon%20Traits.png)

---
### Other Adventuring Gear
There is a whole bunch of other gear you can carry along with you. You can either specify each item, or go with a **Gear Bundle**. A Gear Bundle is an undefined collection of a category of items, such as **Criminal Tools**, **Dungeoneering Kit** or **Noble Courtier Outfit**. Whenever you need an item that would reasonably be in such a Gear Bundle, you have it.
