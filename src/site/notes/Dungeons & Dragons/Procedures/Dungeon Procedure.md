The following is a procedure for crawling through dungeons or dungeon-like environments.

---
# Dungeon Composition
A Dungeon consist of the following elements:
- **Rooms**: These are areas that are of interest to the party, either because of their content or because of their lay-out. Rooms can be explored, searched, and otherwise interacted with. Two Rooms are either directly connected to each other, or connected by **Passageways**. Rooms are usually occupied by **Inhabitants**. 
- **Passageways**: These connect Rooms, and can range from long hallways to collections of smallers rooms and areas that don't hold anything of interest to the party. They require time to traverse, and cursory exploration of these areas while traversing generally don't turn up anything useful or valuable.
- **Inhabitants**: The creatures that call the Dungeon their home, and can be found lurking around. Some of them are keyed to a specific Location, others are Wandering around.

### Dynamic Dungeons
The Dungeon is a living environment. Some of the Inhabitants might be tied to specific Rooms, but they're by no means stationary. Dungeon Inhabitants *will* respond to external stimuli even if they occur outside of their keyed location, and take can actions according to their nature and skill in response to your meddling. 

Each Dungeon will have an **Adversary Roster** that lists which groups of Inhabitants (Adversary Groups) are keyed to which Rooms, but also lists if/how they react to disturbances elsewhere. Naturally, if an Inhabitant leaves their keyed location, the party won't encounter them there anymore.


# The Dungeon Cycle
The procedure in which the party slowly explores a Dungeon is broken down into Dungeon Cycles. A Dungeon Cycle is an indeterminate amount of time in which the characters move, explore, search, or recuperate. The Dungeon Cycle is structured as follows:

1. The DM describes the environment and rehashes the current situation, giving any pertinent information that is immediately noticeable to the characters.
2. The players each declare which (one) action their characters will take during the cycle. Examples of common actions are: 
	- Moving through a Passageway
	- Searching a Room (particularly large Rooms might require you to state a specific area to search)
	- Keeping an eye out for dangers to avoid being Surprised by anything unexpected
	- Overcome an obstacle in your way such as a locked door or a trap
	- Casting a Ritual spell
	- Fight bad guys
3. Everyones' actions resolve simultaneously
4. The DM determines whether to roll the Encounter Dice, and resolves the outcome.
5. Any resources are checked against their duration, the DM's tools and tables are updated, and the Cycle repeats.


## Effect Durations
Time is not meticulously tracked in a Dungeon Cycle. The following guidelines will determine how long a specific effect lasts.

| Duration as written | Duration in Dungeon                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Up to 1 minute      | Untl the end of the current Dungeon Cycle            |
| Up to 10 minutes    | Until the end of the next Dungeon Cycle              |
| Up to 1 hour        | Until the end of a Short Rest                        |
| Longer than 1 hour  | Until a night's rest, or until the Dungeon is exited |

# Wandering in the Dungeon
## Encounter Dice
Whenever the party stays in the same Room for more than one Cycle, traverses down a Passage, or if they do something that could attract unwanted attention, the DM will roll the Encounter Dice to see if any Wandering Encounters happen upon the party. The Encounter Dice are a pool of d6, where the lowest result determines the outcome.
Whenever the party does something especially reckless or noticeable, the DM will add one d6 to the pool. Whenever the party lays low for a Short Rest in a safe location, the DM removes one d6 from the pool. 

Alternatively, the DM can use the following descriptors to determine the Encounter Pool size:

| Descriptor | Encounter Pool |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Calm       | 1d6            |
| Alert      | 2d6            |
| Alarmed    | 3d6            |
| Crisis     | 4d6            |
The Encounter Dice outcomes are as follows:

| Lowest result d6 | Result                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                | A Wandering Encounter occurs. If there's more than a single 1 rolled, the party may be Surprised                                        |
| 2                | Signs of a Wandering Encounter nearby, or an omen of bad things to come. May become encounters depending on the actions of the players. |
| 3                | An Environmental Effect occurs (see below)                                                                                              |
| 4-6              | Quiet                                                                                                                                   |

##### Environmental Effects
When a Dungeon is in high state of alertness, things are always shifting. Even on a high roll of the ED, *something* happens. These Environmental Effects are classified as:

| d6 (optional) | Effect Type               | Environmental Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | **Attrition**             | The Dungeon takes an extra toll on the party, such as a trap going off, a hazard damaging them, or another resource needs to be spent to continue.                                                                                                  |
| 2-3           | **Altered Circumstances** | This is a change that affects future Dungeon Cycles. A way forward may be blocked, or the way out is not available anymore. Other options include increasing the ED pool or other things that increase the difficulty (Adversary Groups may merge). |
| 4-5           | **Minor Choice**          | There's some sort of obstacle that requires the party to make a choice between two or more costs, such as time, putting yourself in danger, drawing attention, or losing something valuable.                                                        |
| 6             | **Flavour/Hint**          | Something about the environment draws the party's attention without doing them harm. What they learn may or may not end up being useful.                                                                                                            |

## Exploring Rooms
When the party enters a Room, the DM describes what they immediately see (**Landmark** information) and any pertinent information they might glean from this. The DM might also call for a reactive roll - such as Perception or a Knowledge check - to see whether the characters immediately notice things less obvious. No time elapses gaining Landmark information: it's what you immediately perceive.

If the party decides to search through a Room, they state what areas they want to investigate. Any clues that were not immediately noticeable, but obvious to any experienced adventurer conducting a thorough search, will be revealed (**Hidden** information). Searching for Hidden information can cost you time (usually one Cycle), it might put you at risk, or both.

Some features might be obscured so well that even a trained adventurer might not uncover it or miss it. Besides spending time and effort looking for it, there's also a risk of simply not uncovering it at all. An appropriate check will be called for, with this **Secret** information being revealed on a success, and remaining obscured on a fail.

## Stealth
If the environment allows for it, the party can elect to try and stay hidden from Inhabitants. As the pace with which a party explores a dungeon is generally slow this doesn't change the time they spend crawling.
Stealthing is not possible when:
- The party carries an active light source
- The party explicitly moves through the Dungeon at a fast pace (when fleeing, for example)
- The lay-out of the Dungeon does not allow for effective hiding (at the DM's discretion).

## Mapping
The players are responsible for mapping their progress through a Dungeon, unless they have somehow procured an accurate map beforehand. The players should designate one of their own as the Mapper. 

### Losing Direction
Some dungeons are straightforward and are difficult to get lost in, but some dungeons have Passageways that are veritable mazes of interconnecting hallways, nooks, and crannies, that don't necessarily have to be relevant or make sense.
In difficult to navigate Passageways, the party will need to elect a Wayfinder to find the right paths. Every time they head into a chaotic Passageway, they make an appropriate ability check to see if they can keep their way. If they lose their way, they have to spend 1 Dungeon Cycle getting back on track (possible invoking more Wandering Encounters).

## Lighting
Unless a Dungeon has its own source of illumination, characters will probably want to carry a source of light. Even characters with Darkvision will have a difficult time properly navigating and exploring a fully dark Dungeon.
Having an active light source in an otherwise dark environment means you can't surprise any Inhabitants, as the light gives you away from a distance.
