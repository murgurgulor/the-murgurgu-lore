From https://www.paperspencils.com/flux-space/

A Flux Space mechanic can be applied when characters are exploring spaces which are **Large**, **Samey**, and **Confusing**. 
Flux Space is a way of representing these environments without mapping and keying them. No maps or keys are needed, because while the _characters_ must trudge through a Flux making meticulous notes and backtracking from dead ends, the _players_ will be “zoomed out.” Time passes very quickly since the players need only make broad administrative decisions. When the characters encounter something interesting the players “zoom in” to engage with it.

Traversing through Flux Space can be regarded as a type of [Point Crawl](http://hillcantons.blogspot.com/2014/11/pointcrawl-series-index.html), with the distinction that moving between each point is especially arduous. Once a Flux is solved it can be peregrinated through more swiftly, but solving it will be taxing.

Flux Space is a mix of overland travel and dungeon exploration. It’s for those situations where an environment exists primarily as an obstacle to forward progress, rather than a rewarding location to explore in its own right. Charting the flux gives space for our imaginations to percolate in these environments, and for them to feel as imposing as they ought to, but does so without straining the players’ patience.

# Flux Space Procedure
When the party enters a **Flux Space**, the play shifts into **Flux Turns**. A Flux Turn is a long but undefined amount of time, and there are 6 in a day (though not every Flux Turn specifically lasts for 4 hours). During a Flux Turn, the party generally acts as a group, with the presumed goal being to find a path through the Flux by **Charting**.

Each Flux Turn spent Charting represents hours of the party moving carefully, making notes, taking measurements, and backtracking from dead ends. All this hard work takes time and effort and is followed by a roll of the **Event Die**. At the end of a successful Charting action, the party will end up at one of the Zones of the Flux. In a Zone, play zooms in for classic style exploration to resolve the Zone, after which the party chooses how to spend their next Flux Turn.

Each Flux Space has a finite number of Zones. Once they have all been discovered, the Flux is fully charted and may be moved through easily.

### Flux Events
Every Flux Turn, The Event Die is rolled. Normally this is 1d6, but specific circumstances and situations may apply **Positive Event Dice** and **Negative Event Dice**. For every Positive Event Dice, roll an additional d6 and take the **highest** number rolled. For every Negative Event Dice, roll an additional d6 and take the **lowest** number rolled. Positive en Negative Event Dice cancel each other out 1-for-1.

The Flux Events are:

| d6  | Event                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2   | Signs of a nearby Encounter, if the party doesn't deal with it, they will encounter it.                                                                                                                                                |
| 3   | Environment Change (See below)<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | Rest or gain 1 Exhaustion<br>The party chooses whether to rest for the remainder of this Flux Turn, or to press on and gain 1 level of Exhaustion. If they rest, the Flux Turn ends and you add a Negative Event Die on the next turn. |
| 56  | Quiet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Zones
A Zone is a notable location within a Flux Space, comparable to a Dungeon Room. A Zone might be as simple as a statue the party can choose to ignore, or it can be a series of challenges and rooms that must be overcome in order to reach the next exit and enter the Flux again.

Zones are categorized as **Surface Zones** and **Deep Zones**. At the end of each Charting, after the Event Die has resolved, the GM rolls on a table of the Flux's Surface Zones. These are closer to the entrance and are more likely to be encountered early. After a Surface Zone is encountered and cleared, it can be crossed off the list. As the party continues to Chart, the GM will at one point roll one of the crossed off Surface Zones again. When this happens, the party discovers a Deep Zone instead. Deep Zones are not rolled, they are encountered in order from first to last.

Once all Zones have been discovered, the Flux Space is solved and doesn't need to be charted any further.

### Flux Turn Actions
- **Chart**: Move methodically through the Flux Space, trying to find your way. At the end of the Flux Turn, you end up in a Zone.
- **Traverse**: Move from any space within the Flux to any previously discovered Zone, even from the entrance to the very deepest of Deep Zones, if it has been found.
- **Lay Low**: The party hunkers down and plans their next moves carefully. Add one Positive Event Die.
- **Make Camp**: Spending more than 4 Flux Turns per day on heavy activity causes 1 level of Exhaustion after every additional Flux Turn. When the party makes camp, one of the players makes a Navigation-type check to find a suitable place to rest for the night. If the check fails, the party has to choose between an **Exposed Campsite**, where encounters are more likely, or an **Uncomfortable Campsite**, where their rest doesn't recover any resources.
	- Each individual party member then chooses whether to **Take Watch** or **Sleep**.
	- If no characters Take Watch, all Encounter Sign rolls become Encounters. 
		- If only one character keeps watch they gain Exhaustion. If two characters keep watch together, neither does.
	- Every character who takes 2 Flux Turns sleeping removes Exhaustion and regains their Resources.


# Maps and Local Knowledge
A Flux Space is never fully known by a party - else it wouldn't be a Flux Space - but they may have some partial maps or knowledge inferred from locals to help them. This may reveal some of a Flux's Zones, which are then treated as already being discovered. This means the party already gets a head start on their Charting. 

Traversing to a Zone based on Map-knowledge alone provides somewhat more risk, as the party tromps along a path that they haven't had a feel for themselves. When Traversing with only Map-knowledge, add one Negative Event Die.

On the other hand, hearing experiences from someone who has been in the Flux Space provides welcome clues and warnings, giving the party a heads up for any dangers. Based on the quality of advice, add one or more Positive Event Dice for a number of Flux Turns.

# Constructing a Flux
A Flux Space consists of several aspects.

### Theme
The most vital part of a Flux is the theme. The theme is what separates a series of grey corridors from a zig-zag staircase maze, or spawling acid-dripping mines. The theme gives the prompts for descriptions at the table and it colours the rest of the Flux's aspects.

### Encounters
Generally a 1d8 or 1d6+1d4 Encounter Table is enough to stock a Flux. There will hardly be more than 3 or 4 expected encounters, barring any excessively long Fluxes. 
Because the space in which Encounters occur is nonspecific, it's good to include a location alog with the encounters ('3 skeletons on a narrow staircase'), or a table of environments could be constructed that is also rolled upon.

### Environmental Effects
Environmental Effects are how the theme is expressed, and how the environment resists the party's attempts to control it. Because a Flux Space is explored from a zoomed out perspective, the Environmental Effects must have clear zoomed out consequences. Generally Environmental Effects fall under 4 different types, which can be rolled or chosen:


| d6 (optional) | Effect Type               | Environmental Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | **Attrition**             | The Flux takes an extra toll on the party, such as a trap going off, a hazard damaging them, or another resources needs to be spent to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2-3           | **Altered Circumstances** | This is a change that affects future Flux Turns. It might add a Negative Event Die, or it might cause the party to need to expend a different resource than expect or change their marching order. The Altered Circumstance lasts until the next time an Environmental Effect is rolled - the effects are replaced, not added on. |
| 4-5           | **Minor Choice**          | There's some sort of obstacle that requires the party to make a choice between two or more costs. For example: the corridor ahead is filled with poisonous gas. You can spend another Flux Turn to find a way around, or you can try to push through somehow, with failure inflicting a negative consequence.                     |
| 6             | **Flavour/Hint**          | Something about the environment draws the party's attention without doing them harm. What they learn may or may not end up being useful.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
Environmental Effects are generally reusable, so 1-3 per type.

### Zones
Generally a d6 table of Surface Zones and 3 Deep Zones is enough content for a Flux. Any bigger and it might as well have been a traditional dungeon. Zones are the same as Dungeon Rooms, though they can be more heavily stocked and consist of multiple physical rooms.
