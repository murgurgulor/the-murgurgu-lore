### Factions and NPCs
##### Merchant Prince Ekena-Afa
**Ekena-Afa** is one of the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru, and our de facto patron in investigating the Death Curse, as she has been resurrected in the past. She is interested in mapping out the unexplored jungles of Chult, aided by the Gnomish cartographer **Dieter Tittlethumb**. This is kept secret from another Merchant Prince - **Azir** - who has a monopoly on maps and geographical information.

##### Order of the Gauntlet
The Order of the Gauntlet is a faction intent on destroying the scourge of undead in the world. When they heard of undead infestations in Chult, they quickly set up an expedition into the jungles. They seem to have bit off more than they can chew, as their first camp - **Camp Righteous**, near the **Temple of Crocodile and Man**, got overrun and destroyed by the indigenous **Batili Goblin** tribe. 

Their second camp - **Camp Vengeance**, is poorly constructed and managed, causing disease to run rampant. One of their scouts recently discovered some ruins to the south - potentially the ruins of **Mbala** - where they are considering moving towards to set up camp.

The Order of the Gauntlet's Chult division is led by **Niles Breakbone** (human). His seconds-in-command are **Ord Firebeard** (Gold Dwarf) and **Pern Salhana*** (human).
Other notable members of the Order are:
- **Sister Cyas** - who takes care of the sick and wounded
- **Wulf Rygor** - ranger who is at least somewhat competent in survivalling, but is somewhat deranged in his plans to burn the whole of Chult down to get rid of the undead
- **Undril Silvertusk** - a half-orc cleric whom we transported to Camp Vengeance and who got us out of some pickles.

Finally, the Order has hired the help of some Chultan natives, led by **Lorsa Bilwatal**. She thought us about herbalism.

##### The Zhentarim
The Zhentarim are an organization who like to dip their fingers in less-than-savoury jobs and projects in order to gain power. Poag has a bad history with them and is paranoid of encountering them here in Chult. They have unfortunately also been hired by Cassandra's great-uncle **Thaddeus Thassas** to look for **Cathas Thassas** - her resurrected great-great-grandfather. Cathas went into the jungles of Chult to look for the fabled **Ring of Winter**. This ring apparently grants immortality and powers over ice and cold. We have learned the location where his journal was found. He has a **Shield Guardian** in his service.

Thaddeus has employed elite Zhentarim agents:
- **Worble**, a human stabbing with daggers and crossbows
- **Stimp**, a deranged Halfling wielding psychic blades
- **Orgnorg**, a Half-Orc Warrior with a love for grappling and throwing

Poag had the Zhentarim convinced he was elite agent **Diognesis Thumbskin**, but after an unfortunate stint we have antagonized them.

##### Cathas Thassas
**Cathas Thassas**, Cassandra's great-great-grandfather, was in Chult looking for the **Ring of Winter**. During our travels we found his fabled Shield Guardian **Vorn** being worshipped by several indigenous peoples. Nearby we found a skeleton with a **Ring of Mind Shielding** that contained Cathas' soul. Cathas wants us to put his soul into a new body so he can continue the family legacy, while we're actually looking for ways to evict his soul from its home.

##### Artus Cimber
We found Artus Cimber encased in a dome of ice, wearing the fabled **Ring of Winter** which grants protection against death. We woke him up from what seemed a century-long slumber. After we told him what's what, he was confused about the falling of **Mezro** and **Ras Nsi**'s actions. Before answering any of our deepest questions he summoned an ice bird and flew off to Mezro.

##### Independents
Other NPCs we've encountered are:
- **Hew Hackinstone**: Our guide with an Ahab-ish obsession with **Tinder**, the Red Dragon who bit off his arm.
- **Kwilgok**: A Tortle dinosaur jockey who is generally chill and laid back.
- **Pirates!**: A crew of pirates, led by **Cpt. Tiffany Cannonview**, harried us on our arrival. We managed to drive them off, but they're still sailing around somewhere, presumable.
- **Volothamp Geddarm (Volo)**: Some guy who writes books about stuff.
- **Flask of Wine** and **River Mist**, two illegal Tabaxi guides who were escorting the **Zhentarim**.

### Locations
##### Port Nyanzaru
The main hub and major city in Chult. It's ruled by 7 Merchant Princes, but there are also some **Beggar Princes** who hold some power over the poorer parts of town. The old part of town is hooked up to a portal - the **Old Gate** that leads to a planar maze of plants, supposedly created by **Ubtao**, that is rumoured to lead to other places in Chult.

Sites we visited in Port Nyanzaru were:
- The **Temple of Sune**, where you can get a wonderful make-over
- The **Temple of Tymora**, where you can gamble
- The **Temple of Gond**, where you can craft
- The **Thundering Lizard Inn**, where we stayed the night

##### Temple of Crocodile and Man
The Temple of Crocodile and Man is situated a few days south from Port Nyanzaru. The Temple depicts the story of Crocodile and Man who rode on each other backs. This also proved to be the key to unlocking the Temple's secret chamber where we found an **Alchemy Jug**, and a portal. We assume the portal leads to the plant-maze-pocket dimension that also connects to **Port Nyanzaru**. The Maze is a challenge to get through, but we learned that going **Right-Right-Right-Left-Left-Straight** will bring us to Port Nyanzaru.

We discerned that the Man represents **Ubtao**, and Crocodile represents **Thard'har**, a nature god related to the Albino Dwarves.

##### Mezro
Mezro is a ruin deep in the undead-infested jungles of Chult that was destroyed around 100 years ago. When the city was under attack, **Ubtao** granted the exiled **Warlord Ras Nsi** powers of necromancy to help defend the city. Ras Nsi then turned on the city instead to overtake it. In the ensuing battle, Ras Nsi was killed. His many, many, many undead minions - marked by a blue triangle - now still roam the jungles uncontrolled.

We've heard that Mezro currently is home to a **psychic crocodile**, which is very exciting. Also, Artus Cimber is currently heading there for unknown reasons.

### Flora and Fauna
We've learned of the following indigenous plants and beasts:
- Chult's jungles are full of **dinosaurs**, some of them undead!
- There are many types of **Grung** in the jungle, with different colours designating different socetial standing. You can extract poison from them.
- **Scented Ferns** are used to create insect repellant, to ward off the disease-carrying flies
- **Sinda Berries** can be used to cure or protect against poisons (requires 10 fresh berries)
- **Zabou Mushrooms** are poisonous mushrooms that explode in a puff of poisonous spores when thrown. **Sinda Berries** protect against them
- **Wukka Nuts** are strange coconuts that emit a light when shaken or rattled
- **Dancing Monkey Fruit** is the party drug of the Chultan jungles
- **Zorbos** are feral and bloodthirsty koalas with magical skin that changes into whatever material it touched most recently

### Religion
##### Ubtao
**Ubtao** is the primordial god of Chult, and its protector. Disappeared around 100 years ago, and no one really seems to know how or why. This seems to coincide with the destruction of **Mezro**, but any relation is conjecture.

From the Temple of Crocodile and Man, it can be inferred that **Ubtao** and **Thard'har** were buddies who liked to ride on each other's back. This is in contrast to the official legend which claims animosity between the two.

Ubtao is the god of mazes, and their believers walk Ubtao's Maze of Life.

##### Thard'har
Chultan God of the Albino Dwarves, often depicted as a crocodile.

##### Aremag
**Aremag** is a giant dragon turtle that patrols the waters near Port Nyanzaru. Any who want to pass will have to present him with a present.
