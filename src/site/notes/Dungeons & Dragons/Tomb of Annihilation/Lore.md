# Current Goals and Objectives

**Expedition Day**: 19

- Surveil the surrounding area from the top of Firefinger and plot the safest course.
- Make our way to Mezro, avoiding the Flaming Fists if possible, and find Artus Cimber.

Sidequests:
- Head to the Aaracokra settlement of Kir Sabal as emissaries of the Temple of Gond, to establish a line of communication in order for the Gondians to get access to the Plane of Air, to make Air Planes.
- Head to the Albino Dwarves to re-open the Hrakhamar Mines and increase the production of Chultan Bronze.
- I guess we should at one point help Hew avenge his family at the Wyrmheart Mines.

# Factions and NPCs

### Merchant Princes 
##### Ekena-Afa
**Ekena-Afa** is our de facto patron in investigating the Death Curse, as she has been resurrected many times in her past as a gladiator. She is interested in mapping out the unexplored jungles of Chult, aided by the Gnomish cartographer **Dieter Tittlethumb**. This is kept secret from another Merchant Prince - **Azir** - who has a monopoly on maps and geographical information.

##### Azir
Merchant Prince Azir has a monopoly of information and maps of all kinds in Chult.

##### Kwayothé
Kwayothé is a Merchant Prince who used to be a priest of Ubtao. 

##### The Beggar Princes
There are three Beggar Princes that hold sway and influence in the Old Town of Port Nyanzaru:
- **Prince Tatunani**: a formal Chultan royal prince
- **Queen Stranglevine**: a goblin that came out of the jungle
- **Hassim the Strange**: a mysterious man who can read minds

### Order of the Gauntlet
The Order of the Gauntlet is a faction intent on destroying the scourge of undead in the world. When they heard of undead infestations in Chult, they quickly set up an expedition into the jungles. They seem to have bit off more than they can chew, as their first camp - **Camp Righteous**, near the **Temple of Crocodile and Man**, got overrun and destroyed by the indigenous **Batili Goblin** tribe. 

Their second camp - **Camp Vengeance**, is poorly constructed and managed, causing disease to run rampant. One of their scouts recently discovered some ruins to the south - potentially the ruins of **Mbala** - where they are considering moving towards to set up camp.

The Order of the Gauntlet's Chult division is led by **Niles Breakbone** (human). His seconds-in-command are **Ord Firebeard** (Gold Dwarf) and **Pern Salhana*** (human).
Other notable members of the Order are:
- **Sister Cyas** - who takes care of the sick and wounded
- **Wulf Rygor** - ranger who is at least somewhat competent in survivalling, but is somewhat deranged in his plans to burn the whole of Chult down to get rid of the undead
- **Undril Silvertusk** - a half-orc cleric whom we transported to Camp Vengeance and who got us out of some pickles.

Finally, the Order has hired the help of some Chultan natives, led by **Lorsa Bilwatal**. She taught us about herbalism.

### The Zhentarim
The Zhentarim are an organization who like to dip their fingers in less-than-savoury jobs and projects in order to gain power. Poag has a bad history with them and is paranoid of encountering them here in Chult. They have unfortunately also been hired by Cassandra's great-uncle **Thaddeus Thassas** to look for **Cathas Thassas** - her resurrected great-great-grandfather. Cathas went into the jungles of Chult to look for the fabled **Ring of Winter**. This ring apparently grants immortality and powers over ice and cold. We have learned the location where his journal was found. He has a **Shield Guardian** in his service.

Thaddeus has employed elite Zhentarim agents:
- **Worble**, a cunning human stabbing with daggers and crossbows
- **Stimp**, a deranged Halfling wielding psychic blades
- **Orgnorg**, a Half-Orc Warrior with a love for grappling and throwing

Poag had the Zhentarim convinced he was elite agent **Diognesis Thumbskin**, but after an unfortunate stint we have antagonized them. Let's hope we never encounter them again.

### The Flaming Fist
The Flaming Fist are a band of mercenaries that was hired by Port Nyanzaru in the Amnian Independence War, 11 years ago. In return they got a base in Fort Beluaran. Additionally, they lay a claim to all treasures found in the jungle. If you want to hunt for treasure in the jungle, you need a charter from the Flaming Fist and share part of the loot, or they will (forcefully) take everything.

There is currently a detachment of the Flaming Fist stationed in/near **Mezro**.

### Individuals of Note
##### Hew Hackinstone
Hew Hackinstone is our one-armed dwarven guide. The Hackinstone Clan used to work at the **Wyrmheart Mine** until one day the red dragon Tinder showed up and decimated the clan. Hew lost his entire family and an arm that day, and lives to seek revenge on Tinder and to reclaim the Wyrmheart Mine.

Hew can't read maps, but he is knowledgeable about quantum mechanics.

##### Cathas Thassas
**Cathas Thassas**, Cassandra's great-great-grandfather, was in Chult looking for the **Ring of Winter**. During our travels we found his fabled Shield Guardian **Vorn** being worshipped by several indigenous peoples. Nearby we found a skeleton with a **Ring of Mind Shielding** that contained Cathas' soul. Cathas wants us to put his soul into a new body so he can continue the family legacy, while we're actually looking for ways to evict his soul from its home.

In a daring game of Fortune's Favor, Cassandra managed to evict Cathas' soul from the ring. Instead of heading to Tymora, however, his soul was pulled towards the center of Chult.

##### Artus Cimber
We found Artus Cimber encased in a dome of ice, wearing the fabled **Ring of Winter** which grants protection against death. We woke him up from what seemed a century-long slumber. After we told him what's what, he was confused about the falling of **Mezro** and **Ras Nsi**'s actions. Before answering any of our deepest questions he summoned an ice bird and flew off to Mezro.


### Independents
Other NPCs we've encountered are:
- **Nephyr**: A captive Aarakocra we saved from the Pterafolk and Tower Firefinger.
- **Musharib**: An Albino Dwarf interested in opening the Hrakhamar Mines to the south to mine **Chultan Bronze**
- **Akambé**: An old man in the Old Town of Port Nyanzaru who is friendly to Poag.
- **Zindar**: The Gold Dragonborn Harbormaster whose breakfast we ate.
- **Kwilgok**: A Tortle dinosaur jockey who is generally chill and laid back.
- **Pirates!**: A crew of pirates, led by **Cpt. Tiffany Cannonview**, harried us on our arrival. We managed to drive them off, but they're still sailing around somewhere, presumable.
- **Volothamp Geddarm (Volo)**: Some guy who writes books about stuff. Currently under scrutiny by Merchant Prince Azir.
- **Flask of Wine** and **River Mist**, two illegal Tabaxi guides who were escorting the **Zhentarim**.

# Locations

### Port Nyanzaru
The main hub and major city in Chult. It's ruled by 7 Merchant Princes, but there are also some **Beggar Princes** who hold some power over the poorer parts of town. The old part of town is hooked up to a portal - the **Old Gate** that leads to a planar maze of plants, supposedly created by **Ubtao**, that is rumoured to lead to other places in Chult.

Sites we visited in Port Nyanzaru were:
- The **Temple of Sune**, where you can get a wonderful make-over
- The **Temple of Tymora**, where you can gamble
- The **Temple of Gond**, where you can craft
- The **Thundering Lizard Inn**, where we stayed the night
- The **Scent of Golden Lotus Inn**, where we have upgraded our accomodations

### Temple of Crocodile and Man
The Temple of Crocodile and Man is situated a few days south from Port Nyanzaru. The Temple depicts the story of Crocodile and Man who rode on each other backs. This also proved to be the key to unlocking the Temple's secret chamber where we found an **Alchemy Jug**, and a portal. We assume the portal leads to the plant-maze-pocket dimension that also connects to **Port Nyanzaru**. The Maze is a challenge to get through, but we learned that going **Right-Right-Right-Left-Left-Straight** will bring us to Port Nyanzaru.

We discerned that the Man represents **Ubtao**, and Crocodile represents **Thard'har**, a nature god related to the Albino Dwarves.

### Mezro
Mezro is a ruin deep in the undead-infested jungles of Chult that was destroyed around 100 years ago. Originally a great capital of the Jakabi tribe, it was ruled by paladins of Ubtao who were gifted immortality and the power to animate the dead: **Barae**. Then, the **Eshowe** tribe turned against Ubtao and the Jakabi declared war. One of the Bara - **Ras Nsi** - decided to genocide the entire Eshowe tribe with his undead minions, even after the war was already won. In retribution, Ras Nsi was exiled from Mezro. He retreated into the jungle and waited for a time when Mezro would call on his help again.

After a thousand years in the jungle, Ras Nsi couldn't wait any longer and decided to lay siege on Mezro with his now gigantic undead army. In the battles that followed, Ras Nsi was slain and Mezro was laid to waste. It's said that **Artus Cimber** also fought Ras Nsi. 
Without their leader, Ras Nsi's undead started roaming the jungles around Mezro. This was around 100 years ago. Ras Nsi's undead are marked by a blue triangle on their head.

We've also heard that Mezro currently is home to a **psychic crocodile**, which is very exciting.
Artus Cimber is currently heading there for unknown reasons.
The Flaming Fist have an outpost near Mezro.

### Mbala
A ruin down the river Shoshenstar. Starvation emptied the city and now it's supposedly haunted - but no one has really visited in decades.
The **Order of the Gauntlet** thought it would be a good idea to settle down there.

### Tower Firefinger
A tall lighthouse-like structure close to the **River Tiryki**, in the undead-infested lands around **Mezro**. It was one of many old messaging towers that communicated through coloured flames/smoke. Many have fallen over time due to the many tremors in Chult, but Firefinger remains.

A tribe of **Pterafolk** live near it, and carry unsuspecting people off to their nests. We managed to sneak up, make our way to the top - freeing the Aarakocra captive Nephyr - and wiped out *almost* all the Pterafolk there...

### Kir Sabal
A settlement of the Aarakocra, south east of Mezro.

# Nature

### Flora
- **Scented Ferns** are used to create insect repellant, to ward off the disease-carrying flies
- **Sinda Berries** can be used to cure or protect against poisons (requires 10 fresh berries)
- **Zabou Mushrooms** are poisonous mushrooms that explode in a puff of poisonous spores when thrown. **Sinda Berries** protect against them
- **Wukka Nuts** are strange coconuts that emit a light when shaken or rattled
- **Dancing Monkey Fruit** is the party drug of the Chultan jungles
- **Menga Leaves** can be used to brew a tea that lets you regain HP, with a max of 5 drinks per 24 hours
- **Ryath Root** can be eaten for beneficial properties, consisting of Temporary Hit Points. Brontosauri love this shit.
- **Empath Peas** are latent psychic peas. If you squeeze one pea, all the other peas of its pod will scream - regardless of distance! They spoil after 7 days, however.

### Fauna
We've learned of the following indigenous plants and beasts:
- Chult's jungles are full of **dinosaurs**, some of them undead!
- There are many types of **Grung** in the jungle, with different colours designating different socetial standing. You can extract poison from them.
- **Jaculi** are giant chameleon-camouflaged constrictor snakes that can jump
- **Almiraj** are unicorn rabbits, a species not native to Chult
- **Kamadan** are leopard-snake hybrids 
- **Chwinga** are small spriggan-like sprites who like magical stuff and appear to be generally altruistic in nature
- **Zorbos** are feral and bloodthirsty koalas with magical skin that changes into whatever material it touched most recently
- **Su Monsters** are crazy psychic bat-monkey hybrids that can assault your mind. Eating their brain enhances pre-existic psychic/telepathic abilities.

### Other phenomena
- **Blue Monkey Mist** is a thick blue mist that travels across the land. Spending any time inhaling the mist can cause you to go insane!
- **Chultan Bronze** is a valuable alloy of bronze and adamantine.

# Religion

### Ubtao
**Ubtao** is the primordial god of Chult, and its protector. He disappeared around 100 years ago, and no one really seems to know how or why. This seems to coincide with the destruction of **Mezro**, but any relation is conjecture. Ubtao is the god of mazes, and their believers walk Ubtao's Maze of Life. 

From the Temple of Crocodile and Man, it can be inferred that **Ubtao** and **Thard'har** were buddies who liked to ride on each other's back. This is in contrast to the official legend which claims animosity between the two.

However, Ubtao isn't all labyrinths and piggybacks: the **Legend of the Aldani** tells the tale of fishermen in the Aldani Basin who fished fish from river Shoshenstar and sold the fish for profit. Ubtao frowned on this and turned the entire village into crab people.

### Thard'har
Chultan God of the Albino Dwarves, often depicted as a crocodile.

### Aremag
**Aremag** is a giant dragon turtle that patrols the waters near Port Nyanzaru. Any who want to pass will have to present him with a present.

# Magic Loot
- **Alchemy Jug**: Found in the Temple of Crocodile and Man
- **Tiger Mask of the Beast**: Found at the top of Tower Firefinger
