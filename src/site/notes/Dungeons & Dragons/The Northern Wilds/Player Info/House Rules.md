The following rules are in addition to the Rules As Written (RAW):
- You get an extra Feat at character creation.
- Everyone gets One Free Inspiration at the start of every session. You can use this Inspiration to give yourself Advantage on a roll, or to reroll a roll you failed. This Free Inspiration doesn't stack: use it or lose it.
- If you roll for Hit Points on level-up, you can also use Inspiration to gain Advantage on the HP roll.
- Rest and recovery:
	- A **Short Rest** functions as usual, taking 30-60 minutes of in-game time.
	- A **Long Rest** only happens when you take a full day's rest in a peaceful environment.
	- In between these two, there's a **Medium Rest** which occurs after a night's sleep. After a Medium Rest you get the following:
		- All the benefits from a Short Rest
		- You recover a number of Hit Dice equal to half your level rounded up
		- You roll 1 Hit Die + Con modifier to heal HP for free, and can spend more Hit Dice to heal up more (as in a Short Rest).
- Combat:
	- After Initiative is rolled for combat, you can choose to voluntarily lower your Initiative.
	- We will use the **Weapon Mastery** rules as explained here on pages 2-4: https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/ph-playtest5/owThVp1CESZ1c91y/UA-2023-PH-Playtest5.pdf
		- Specifically, the Ranger and Barbarian get to choose 2 Weapon Masteries that they have access to. Whenever you attack with a weapon that has a Mastery you have access to, you get to apply its effect on a hit. You can change your Weapon Mastery choices after every Long Rest.
	- If you want to drink a healing potion, you can choose to use a Bonus Action or an Action to do so. If you use a Bonus Action, you roll for the healing as usual. If you use your Action, you gain the maximum amount of healing.
	- Disarming, Shoving, Tumbling and other Combat Maneuvers are allowed. 
	- If you Counterspell a Counterspell, something strange will happen...


### Abstract Distances
In case combat starts in a non-gridded environment, the following Abstract Distances are used to describe locations and relative distances from each other.
Characters with more movement than others might be able to reach areas that others cannot.

- **Engaged** (within 5ft of you)
	- You are standing right next to an enemy, you threaten their area and are threatened by them. 
	- You can only target Engaged enemies with abilities and spells that have a range of at least 5ft.
	- Ranged Attacks are made with Disadvantage
- **Nearby** (10-60ft away from you)
	- You are within one movement's distance from an enemy. If you spend your full movement, you can Engage with them. 
	- You can only target Nearby enemies with abilities and spells that have a range of **at least** 10ft.
- **Far Away** (>60ft away from you)
	- You are two movement distances or more from an enemy. If you spend your full movement you are Nearby them, and if you Dash you can Engage with them. 
	- You can only target Far Away enemies with abilities and spells that have a range of **more than** 60ft.

##### AoE Targets
Use the following guidelines to determine how many targets you can affect with an AoE effect:

| Area                   | Targets (rounded up)                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cone                   | (Size / 10) **Nearby** targets (roughly) in a group              |
| Cube/Square            | (Size / 5) **Nearby** or **Far Away** targets                    |
| Cylinder/Sphere/Circle | (Radius / 5) **Nearby** or **Far Away** targets                  |
| Line                   | (Length / 30) **Nearby and/or Far Away** targets in a rough line |
