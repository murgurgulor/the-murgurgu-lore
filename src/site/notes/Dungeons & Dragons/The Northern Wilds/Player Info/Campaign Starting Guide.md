# Lore

### Campaign Setting
The campaign takes place in the northern part of the continent. Most of the southerners call this area *The Northern Wilds*, but to those who call it their home it's just the North.

There are three countries in the North:
- **Asainn** is the largest and connects to the southern continent. It's a large country that consists of three different provinces. It's governed by the Ruling Council, which consists of three consuls - one from each province. It's capital city is **Caol Arrad**, a prosperous port city on the southern end of the country.
- **Skalmyr** lies north east of Asainn. It's a relatively laid back country that focuses their efforts on their fishing activities along their coastline. They maintain friendly relations and trade with Asainn. Its capital city is **Snykeste**, an overgrown fishing town on the eastern coast. 
- **Boreund** lies north west of Asainn and west of Skalmyr. It's a harsh country with many mountains and - with the exception of its southern borders - icy plains. It extends far to the north into the polar region. Its inhabitants are a rough and tough crowd who maintain at best neutral relations with their neighbouring countries. It's capital city is the mountain fortress **Bor Bradrak**.

The western end of the North is a region called **The Wild Hinterlands**. This is a not a true country, but rather a savage and inhospitable region that a large number of tribes of monstrous humanoids - such as goblins, kobolds, gnolls, orcs, et cetera - call their home. They are territorial and often in conflict with each other. The Wild Hinterlands borders on Asainn and Boreund, and raids on border town are not uncommon.

 A large mountain range cuts horizontally through the North, separating the different countries. This mountain range is called **The Carnan Meoírd**.

Finally: **Skalhaug** is a large island/mountain range off Skalmyr's coast. It's mostly uninhabitable, but you can find small villages on the coastline. There is no central government between them.

### Other Interesting Facts

##### The Church of the Dragon
Over the past year, the controversial **Church of the Dragon** has gained popularity in the North. Its followers believe that one day True Dragons will emerge - Dragons of high intelligence and wisdom that will usher humanoidkind into an age of peace and prosperity under their kind guidance. As such, the Church elevates those of the dragonborn race, and the Church has hailed the increase in dragon attacks with glee, believing that it is the beginning of a new era. Those who don't follow the Church frown upon their excitement about the destruction the dragons bring.

##### Arcanica
500 years ago, the world started a terrible age. Advancements in magic made by the so-called **Arcanists** leapt ahead, and their ever more powerful creations - **Arcanica** - were starting to get used for warfare. Soon a worldwide arms race was in effect and widespread war followed. These wars, fought with weapons of immense power, caused destruction on an apocalyptic level. It all ended when most militaries were wiped out through an event of mutually assured destruction, now 414 years ago. This event became known as the **Arcanists' Cataclysm**.

The world recovered, magic was briefly deemed a taboo, but as time went on magic use became commonplace again. The current expertise is nowhere near that of the Arcanists of old, but people are learning. In the ruins of the old world, sometimes you can still find one of the old Arcanica. Governments then acquire them for study and cataloguing, but sometimes they're found by treasure hunters who sell them on the black market for exorbitant prices.

### Campaign Hook
It all started when you saw the following notice posted on a board:

---
*A Call to Arms*

*The Ruling Council of Asainn calls all able-bodied folk to arms. The resurgence in draconic attacks on our coastal settlements over the past few years has had its strain on both morale and numbers of our Realmguard. The resulting relocation of our Guards from elsewhere in our domain has spread our defenses treacherously thin. To our dismay, the Monstrous Tribes of the Western Hinterlands have seen their opportunity and have started increasing their raids and attacks upon our border towns.*

*We hereby summon and command all Dukes, Earls and Governors of Asainn's domains to send a levy of no less than eight per-cent of their able-bodied folk to strengthen our Realmguard and ensure safety for us all. We furthermore encourage any independent adventurers, mercenaries and knights of fortune to join our noble cause as well. Any of such willing may present themselves to the Ruling Council in Caol Arrad for assessment and assignment.*

*Handsome rewards may apply.*

*As was written and signed by the Ruling Council of Asainn, on the 17th Day of the Shy Moon, 414 AAC.*

Dragons are feral and vicious beasts. In the past they've been hunted to near extinction by specialised dragon hunters, but they have never been fully eradicated. Dragon attacks on towns in the North have always been an accepted part of life, usually only happening once or twice a year. Over the past few years, however, the number of dragon attacks have increased.

This increase in dragon attacks has forced the country of Asainn to relocate its guards, leaving the border with the Western Hinterlands relatively unguarded. This has prompted the Monstrous Tribes (as the inhabitants in the Western Hinterlands are collectively called) to increase their raids and attacks on the border towns. For whatever reason, your character wants to answer Asainn's call for help in the Western Hinterlands.

### Campaign Start
Our campaign starts with all of you in the employ of the Halfling merchant Terrilick Gumsby. He has hired you to escort his caravan of trade goods from the town of Stilvan (in Skalmyr) through the Carnan Meoírd towards Caol Arrad in Asainn.

# Your Characters

### Creating your Character
When creating your character, you can make use of the character builder on D&D Beyond. If you join the campaign there, you also have access to all the digital resources. 

You can create your character using the following link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/join/56979542675251148
Select the following options when creating your character to ensure you get the right content and setting:

![Screenshot_20240715-102115.png](/img/user/z_attachments/The%20Northern%20Wilds/Screenshot_20240715-102115.png)
![Screenshot_20240715-101819.png](/img/user/z_attachments/The%20Northern%20Wilds/Screenshot_20240715-101819.png)

We start your character at **Level 2**. You will level up to level 3 after the first quest.

Keep the following things in mind when creating your character:
- Any race is allowed, but if you don't feel like looking through all of the specifics you can always choose **Custom Lineage**: this is just an easy template of racial features that you can put any race on that you want. So for example you can still be a Dwarf and use the Custom Lineage rules rather than the Dwarf rules.
- Everyone gets a Feat upon character creation. This is in addition to any Feat you might get from your racial choice (such a Custom Lineage).
- Some of the classes have optional features from the book 'Tasha's Cauldron of Everything', you are free to choose from these for your character (included in the D&D Beyond character builder)
- When choosing a Background, you can either choose one provided by the books or think of your own custom Background. If you do so, choose one of the following options that apply
	- Choose 2 Skill Proficiencies and 2 Tool Proficiences that fit your Background
	- Choose 2 Skill Proficiencies and 2 Languages that fit your Background
	- Choose 2 Skill Proficiencies, 1 Tool Proficiency and 1 Language that fit your Background
- You have all rolled for your ability scores. If you are very unhappy with your results, I will allow you to change the scores to that of the Standard Array: 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15. The ability scores that you decide on when we start the first session is the one that sticks!
- Please feel free to have a free reign with crafting your backstory. The world we create is there to be filled in with your imagination as well! If you'd like a certain detail about the world to be true to work for your character, let me know and we can see how we can incorporate it together!
