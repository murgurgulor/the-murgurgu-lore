### Events
After having left the Council's Tower, the party makes their way through the thickening crowds of the late afternoon. Suddenly Mariun feels a tug, and notices her money pouch has been stolen by a cloaked figure! The party give chase through the streets and over several tiers of the city, until Betsy finally apprehends the figure by appealing to his morality. The thief is a young half-elf teen, who explains that ever since his dad died and the government has failed to compensate them, he's been forced to steal in order to keep him and his mum fed. The party gets their money back and give the youngster some tips on how to steal more effectively.

The party splits ways. Rowan heads to Jon Batcock to buy a very expensive gilded acorn. She has it adorned in an arm band, together with one of her scales that she pries off in front of a shocked Jon Batcock. The other party members head to the markets and buy some Health Potions and Unhealth Poisons.

Betsy, Mariun and Nun then head to the library to learn more about the weird mark on the Kobold's shoulder. After interrogating some nerds they learn that the mark is a shamanistic rune. They learn through books that shamanism is spirit magic, and considered a primitive and dangerous form of magic. By invoking spirits - whatever those may be - magical effects are achieved, but spirits may have their own agenda or desires as well... They also learn that this specific mark means that the Kobold was imbued with a spirit, and the flames erupting meant the spirit escaped the body as it died.

Rowan meanwhile heads back to the Church of the Dragon. There she talks with Tirin, the Gold Dragonborn that leads the church, who is in awe of her scaling and inquires about her heritage. From the Dragonborn she learns that someone with similar scaling to her and two differently-coloured eyes was a guest of the church a few months ago. She was found by some parishioners wandering the streets of Caol Arrad in confusion. They brought her to the church where she was fed and clothed in silver robes, and given a room to sleep in. The next morning, however, she had departed before dawn. Rowan inspects the room the person slept in but doesn't find any other clues.

The party rejoins in the Marinating Mermaid and find that there's an invitation for them! Counciler Vello Cadhla has invited them for a party in his mansion: The Emerald Hall. The party takes him up on the invite and visit his party. The mansion is lavishly decorated with marble, metallic details and lots and lots of green. They spot Riqardo and his two buddies standing awkwardly in the corner, hamfisting their glasses of wine. After some small talk with Vello's pompous hanger-ons, the party decides that parties aren't really their thing. Except for Betsy, who takes up a dance with Sigewine of Kyleminster. Through her dance she learns from Sigewine that Vello really is a fresh wind in Asainnian politics. The other councilors are old and set in their ways, but Vello really takes an interest in the people. He even visits the western front from time to time! He also lets slip that the people in Glen Fior - where Vello is originally from - don't seem to take to kindly to him. Apparently he went into politics with grand plans for the region, but they feel he hasn't done enough for them at all, instead enjoying a grand lifestyle in the capital city. Betsy finished the dance with some thievery.

While Rowan stands next to Riqardo in absolute silence and Mariun sits on the ground polishing her weapons, Nun pops his trusty stash of laxatives in the wine fountain. One by one nobles start to excuse themselves to find the lavatory. The party ends early and Vello - seemingly with full control over his bowels - thanks the party for coming and hopes to see them when he visit the western front again in a few weeks!

The next day passes without incident, and the day after the party gathers at the docks to board their ship: The Sandspear! They notice Riqardo and his pals boarding as well. On the deck, they're greeted by a pompous elf bard with brightly coloured clothes, goatee and twirly moustache. He introduces himself as Fillegrin the Bold, and he hopes to find inspiration for heroic poems and ballads by following adventurers in the war effort in the west. While Fillegrin's harping is quite excellent, his ability to write his own material is quite abysmal.

Betsy takes Fillegrin up on some lyre-lessons while they sail around Glen Fior towards their destination: Port Hawis. One evening Nun tells the Legend of Tanngsaost: a legendary goat monster roaming the forests of his hometown. He reveals to the group that there actually was no goat monster, he just made it up because some people came too close to the cave where he stores his stuff, embellishing it by creating a monstrous figure out of goat and deer flesh. After killing a few trespassers and blaming it on the goat monster, however, the tale started to draw adventurers looking to slay the beast! In the end Nun solved the issue by putting the homemade golem near the town, and pretending to slay the creature himself. Some adventurers had to die but hey, all in a day's work.

The last leg of the boat trip is over a stretch of water known as the Baleford. The sailors are tense, because sometimes Sahuagin attack ships here. And wouldn't you know it, soon after they learn this, some Sahuagin attack the ship! The party manages to fight the Sahuagin off, with the help of a trusty Orca spirit. To their surprise, the Sahuagin seemed interested in kidnapping one of the deckhands: a young girl named Wishti McNally. Thankfully they manage to save her from a watery doom.

After this excitement, the ship approaches the Bulwark: the gigantic circular wall that surrounds Port Hawis on both land and sea. They have reached the west! From here it's only a short walk to their new home: Dun Ballantein.
