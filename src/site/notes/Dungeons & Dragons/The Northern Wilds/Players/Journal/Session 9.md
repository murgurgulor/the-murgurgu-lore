### Events
The party catches their breath as Nun's Alarm starts blaring in his mind. This is quickly joined by the sounds of growling, snarling and hollering echoing through the tunnels. The group barricades themselves in the Smithy with webs, hidden coals, and a cute teddy owlbear. A group of Gnolls heading their way finds their death in this terrifying and cute gauntlet. Mariun loses her handaxes but immediately gains some others. As some of the bodies start to catch fire and smoke starts filling the room, they head to the hidden trapdoor to escape.

In the hidden tunnels, they hear more gnolls heading towards them from the other direction. They square off in these dark tunnels and slay gnolls. Rowan eats a hyena. In doing so, they free a Kobold slave that was being tugged along by the gnolls. The Kobold eloquently introduces himself as Trevor, and states proudly he is one of the Boboldim: Kobolds who devote themselves to the study of the world and history. Trevor draws them a map of the Felwarren, and he explains that the Gnoll Matriarch left with a large contingency of veteran gnolls a few weeks ago to help with an excavation. He also explains that 
- the Dracharkan (translated: 'Dragoncaller') is an artifact from the pre-cataclysmic times that enables the user to call dragons towards them from far and wide. 
- Warlord Norgomgr employs a shaman known as 'the Witchwoman' who wields spiritual magic, some say she is the source of his powers.
Trevor thanks the party profusely as he sets off to head back to the Tower of the Boboldim (which he conveniently marks on the party's map).

The party pushes on and heads towards the Matriarch's chambers. Along the way they walk past a blocked up passageway of which they make a mental note to examine later after 'ethnically cleansing' the Felwarren. They arrive at the door to the Matriarch's chamber, where they deal with some guards. Rowan eats a gnoll. Through the crumbling clay on the wall next to the chambers, they see some fancy brickwork with some mozaic iconography. Rowan realizes that there used to be a huge metropolis in the place where the Felwarren is now, and the tunnels are actually former streets. Furthermore, the mozaic indicates that there used to be a teleportation system somewhere in this area.

They break into the Matriarch's chambers and subject it to a thorough search. They manage to uncover some texts that reveal the following:
- the location of Norgomgr's Fortress
- a summons to aid in the excavation of 'the most powerful bones', with a map that indicates the same big clearing that the group spotted before
- plans to destroy the Tower of the Boboldim

They also find 3 nice potions, and a secret door that leads to the outside as an emergency exit.

The party leaves the Matriarch's chambers and pushes their way towards the Feast Hall. They learn from the displayed carcasses that the gnolls apparently view Giants as enemies. They continue on towards the Altar of Yeenoghu, where the group encounters a horde of abyssal hyenas and the highest ranking gnoll currently in the Felwarren: the Fang of Yeenoghu, drinking in the profane energies radiating from an effigy of Yeenoghu. Betsy magically suggests to the Fang to take the head off the effigy and run it outside, and it grudgingly obliges. As the big bad is trotting off, the party slaughters the remaining hyenas and gnolls. Then they hurry after the Fang and slay it to rest.

They battle their way through the quickly declining number of remaining gnolls and head to the Slave Pens. There they free the slaves and they head on to the Charnel Pit. Inside the Charnel Pit, they spot a relatively fresh body wearing the uniform of Dun Ballantein. They grab the dead scout's notebook with a Mage Hand and learn that the excavation site is home to the skeleton of a giant dragon!

Going for 100% completion, the party explores a few more areas and finally head back to the blocked up passage. They tear it down and continue on down a long and dark corridor. It ends up in a large hexagonal chamber with a raised platform with arcane sigils. Veins of crystal run through the room and onto the platform, as waves of chaotic magic permeate the air. Rowan intuits that this must be the teleporter she learned of earlier, and she thinks she can figure out how to make it work. The party pours their arcane energies into the device and power it on. As they get teleported, they feel that the magical energies are off, the teleporter is malfunctioning! They blip for a second, and find themselves on another platform in a different cave. Heading out of the cave, they find themselves high up in the mountains, several hundreds of miles east of the Felwarren in the mountains on the border between Asainn and Boreund. They identify the Dun Ballantein outpost of Dun Athol far below. The party rests their weary bones in a Long Rest, and think about where to go tomorrow.

Also level 6.
