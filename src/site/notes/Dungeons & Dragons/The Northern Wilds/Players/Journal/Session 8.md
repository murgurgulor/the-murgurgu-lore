### Events
The party reminisces about their downtime in Dun Ballantein. Mariun and Rowan made some headway on their combined combat maneuvers but haven't perfected it yet. Nun and Betsy fondly remember their new contact: a Golden Dragonborn with the illustrious name Penny Gobbletooth - the head of the kitchen staff in Dun Ballantein. She has a lot of feelers and connections through scullery maids and serving boys in the fortress. They can use her contacts to exert some form of influence.

Back in the real time, the party finds themselves at the entrance of the Felwarren: a dark and dank cave opening in the mountains, guarded by 6 Gnolls and 12 Abyssal Hyenas. The party devises a cunning plan with fake shrubbery and real tangly vines to efficiently and quickly take them out.

Venturing in the Felwarren, they find themselves in a maze of tunnels, nooks, and crannies. Looking for the missing scouts, they magically Pass without a Trace to remain hidden from any wandering Gnolls. After a short hike they come to a crossroads, where they discern a lot of Gnoll-noises coming from the path straight ahead. After some confusing discussion between Rowan in Hyena-shape and the rest of the party, they decide to randomly choose a passage and go left. 

After carefully traversing for a while, they see a room coming up being used by the Gnolls as a smithy, with two Gnolls smithing over large braziers of fire and 3 Gnolls testing out weapons on each other. The party engages in combat, in which Nun tips over one of the large wobbly braziers by hitting it with a well-placed arrow, covering one of the Gnoll Blacksmiths in burning coals. They quickly take care of the rest with expert attacks.

Searching a room beyond the smithy, they find a Trophy Room with many valuables. The party manage to find an **Alchemy Jug**, **Immovable Rod** and a single **Sending Stone**! They also find valuables worth a total of 640 gp. Finally, they find a hidden trapdoor that leads to a deeper tunnel. After following it for a while, they see (day)light at the end of the tunnel, but also another tunnel branching off to the right. After some debating, the party heads outside first and they find themselves in the hills close to the Felwarren. They take a short rest.

Afterwards they explore the other branch in the tunnels and find it blocked by unmortared bricks. From beyond they hear high-pitched squeaks. The party decides to kick down the wall, and they find themselves in a room filled with Gnoll Cubs. They also see four swollen and lethargic Gnolls females on straw mats nursing the cubs, and a number of Gnolls attendants and Abyssal Hyenas. A fight ensues once again, where the hyenas futily nip at Mariun. Betsy revels in collecting Gnoll tails. They leave the broodmothers and cubs, and move on towards the other exit in this room.

Finding themselves in another large tunnel again they venture forth, Passing without Trace. Coming at a crossroads again, they discern that straight on they hear more rowdy Gnoll noises. This time they decide to take the center road. They realize, judging from the size of this area and the amount of Gnolls they have seen so far, that there are far fewer Gnolls in this complex than one would expect.

Further along the way they encounter a single Gnoll but a few well-placed arrows take him out before he can alarm anyone. Afterwards Nun sneaks up to a room ahead. The room is disgusting: rotting carcasses of many creatures are chained and splayed on the wall, acting as a walking buffet for the many (34) Gnolls and (10) Hyenas in this room eating and drinking. He also sees a large cauldron in the center with a simmering thick cream-coloured liquid. One of the Gnolls stands out, as being larger and wearing a cloak made of skins. The other Gnolls treat this one with reverence.

The party decides to leave this repulsive dinner party for now and track back, taking the now left road at the crossroads. Traveling down in this direction, they quickly hide as they hear something coming up ahead. They see a single Gnoll with a whip walking by with 7 emaciated and beaten humanoids in their bare skin. They engage the Gnoll, hoping to free the slaves, but the slaves turn on the party! Apparently they have been so Stockholm Syndromed that they would give their lives for their master. With cunning, Betsy illusions herself as the Gnoll master and commands the confused slaves to head to the Feast Hall and tip over the big cauldron.

As the slaves run off to obey, Nun sets up an Alarm and the party continues and finds themselves back at the smithy. They wonder if their presence here has been noticed...

### Items gained
>[!tip]+ Alchemy Jug
>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. The jug sloshes when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.
>
>You can take a **Magic** action and name one liquid from the _Alchemy Jug_ Liquids table to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as a **Utilize** action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named. Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.
>
>>Alchemy Jug Liquids:
>>**Acid**: 8 ounces
>>**Basic Poison**: 4 ounces
>>**Beer**: 4 gallons
>>**Honey**: 1 gallon
>>**Mayonnaise**: 2 gallons
>>**Oil**: 1 quart
>>**Vinegar**: 2 gallons
>>**Water, fresh**: 8 gallons
>>**Water, salt**: 12 gallons
>>**Wine**: 1 gallon

>[!tip]+ Immovable Rod
>This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take a **Utilize** action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature takes a **Utilize** action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can take a **Utilize** action to make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.

>[!tip]+ Sending Stone
>_Sending Stones_ come in pairs, with each stone carved to match the other so the pairing is easily recognized. While you touch one stone, you can cast **Sending** from it. The target is the bearer of the other stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone, and you don't cast the spell. Once Sending is cast using either stone, the stones can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical.
