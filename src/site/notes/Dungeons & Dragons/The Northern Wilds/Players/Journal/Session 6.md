### Events
Betsy conjures the illusion of a stone cube around the party as they ascend the tower. In the next levels they see a group of four goblins who are extremely surprised at seeing a massive block of stone move up the stairs. This floor gives a view all the way up to the top of the tower, where a large copper bell hangs gleaming. On the floors above they see four more goblins walking around: three crackling with spiritual energy, and one waving a large staff around coalescing spirits.

A fight ensues, spread over multiple levels of the tower. It quickly becomes a match in who can pull the most enemies off the balconies to crash into the floor below. Rowan turns into a Giant Hyena to rip some goblins to shreds, while Mariun uses her Rage and Halberd to cleave several goblins in two. Nun and Betsy provide support fire from below, combined with spiders and illusions. 

At one point, the Spirit of the Librarian forms and telepathically asks everyone present what information he can help them with. The Mind Goblin calls for the location of the Dracharkan, and an image is inserted in everyone's mind: a dark cave opening set high in the mountains, with a coastline to the north and tundra far to the north east. To the west and south more mountains are visible, and to the east, far below, the signature highlands of northern Asainn.

In turn, Rowan asks the Librarian what the deal is with the Church of the Dragon and their belief in True Dragons - dragons that are intellectual and wise. Everyone gets shown a sequence of images. First an image of dragons gathered together, intellect and understanding in their eyes, engaging in spirited conversation. The next image shows hordes of dragons fighting each other in the sky, with cunning formations and tactics. The next image shows the dragons roaring in agony as a purple aura covers them. The last image shows dragons, feral and snarling, ripping each other to shreds. The information that is conveyed is that at one point in history, dragons were indeed intelligent. Then something happened to them that ended up making them the feral, aggressive beasts that they are today.

Returning to the fight, the Mind Goblin gets shoved down the tower balcony and crashes to the floors below. Rowan-Hyena also gets shoved down, but angles her fall so she crashes into the Mind Goblin. The Mind Goblin then uses tricky teleportations to get himself out of danger, and to pull his allies into attacks meant for him! The Mind Goblin finally tries to escape, as he has the information he came for, and slides down the bell rope down the tower. He blasts Nun with his staff - which Nun discerns is actually an inscribed elven thigh bone - who falls unconscious. Mariun swan dives down gracefully and crashes herself into the Mind Goblin. Finally, Rowan-Hyena rushes down and rips out the Mind Goblins' neck. The Spirit of the Librarian dissipates.

Rowan quickly heals up Nun, and the party rushes to the stash of loot they saw there earlier. They find some magic scrolls and some cool magic items. After a Short Rest, the party makes their way back to the mines and finds the enthralled villagers of Stronbeg standing around in confusion. The party shows their Dun Ballantein insignia and the villagers praise them for saving them. They were being used for hard manual labour by the goblins, and now they're finally free! The party reunites with Dreamwulf and everyone sits down to eat and take a Long Rest before heading back to Stronbeg in the morning. Betsy reads some ancient erotica and has a mysterious dream. Rowan has a disturbing dream of her own.

The next morning, they make the trek back to Stronbeg and reunite the missing villagers with their families. Most of them anyway. They once again get thanked profusely, after which the party - including Dreamwulf - mounts up and starts making their way back to Dun Ballantein.
