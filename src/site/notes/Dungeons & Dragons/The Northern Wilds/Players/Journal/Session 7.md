### Events
Betsy, Rowan and Mariun get dropped off by Santa's Sleigh back on the way to Dun Ballantein, wondering where Nun is. Suddenly they hear loud vaguely-human screaming and yelling from the forest, followed by Nun running out of the forest, followed by four Goatfolk. A fight ensues with the party and the Goatfolk, led by the drunk Satyr Pachinko. Nun gets relentlessly beaten down by the angry goats and forcefully inebriated by Pachinko, but in the end the group manages to kill off the Goatfolk and drive Pachinko away, who vows vengeance. 

After three more days of travel the group returns to Dun Ballantein. Making their way to General Maeve's office, they run into a group of other soldiers led by the same pompous youth who was bullying Fillegrin the Bold earlier - Robbis Freendruch. Betsy immediately starts telepathically screaming in his head. He is very rude to the party and obviously thinks himself superior over everyone else - especially women. The party doesn't budge, however, and a stand-off ensues in which the party employs various ways to take up more space. Finally an illusion of Robbis' angry mother drives him away. He leaves with the remark that "when Mr. Vello comes, he'll tidy up this place!"

The party meets with General Maeve, who also seems very frustrated with her recent encounter with Robbis. She reveals that she doesn't like him, but has to put up with him as he's the son of a noble's family somewhere in Skalhaug, and his family is in good graces with Vello Cadhla. The party suggests sending him away somewhere far away, perhaps with the party where he could possibly meet an unfortunate accident. Maeve decides against assassinating her own troops, but will consider sending Robbis away. They talk a bit more about Vello's impending visit in three weeks, and Maeve reveals she doesn't fully trust him. After some prying and incorrect assumptions of a romantic involvement, Maeve reveals that whenever he visits, he is away for several days longer than his itinerary would account for. She doesn't think he does anything malevolent, but she thinks he might be involved in some smuggling activities. The party suggests they tag along with his visit as an honour guard, which Maeve thinks is a very good idea.

In the meantime, Maeve has another job for the group. She's lost contact with a ranger group who was scouting in the Hinterlands near the Felwarren: an underground domain of a pack of Gnolls - feral hyena-humanoids with a lust for blood, violence and the worship of Yeenoghu, the Demon Lord of Slaughter. The last message she received was that they saw something strange: an exodus of Gnolls into the woods. Maeve also briefs the party on the current situation in the Hinterlands: around a year ago, a new Orc Warlord named Norgomgr rose up to unite the different Monstrous Tribes. Perhaps what the rangers discovered is Norgomgr rallying his troops? The party agrees to travel through the Hinterlands to the Felwarren and find out what happened to the rangers and what they discovered.

The party takes a few days to prepare for their trip, during which Rowan and Mariun practice fighting together when Rowan serves as a mount for Mariun. Nun and Betsy take some time to make connections in Dun Ballantein and get acquainted with the various Quartermasters. Nun gets his Cold Iron Ore forged into 20 arrows and Betsy goes looking for Robbis to scream in his head some more.

The party studies the map for their trip, and finally decide on taking a route through the forest. Roles get divided and the crew sets out! Traveling through the dense woods of the Hinterlands forest, the party comes across various interesting experiences:
- They encounter the illustrious **Time Being**, a being that chaotically blips through time and has apparently met the party before - in their future, in which Nun apparently loses an arm and they get devoured by a Tarrasque! The Time Being reveals that in their near future there the Felwarren is not the most interesting thing they'll encounter soon, but a skeleton...
- They encounter some hunters led by **Mace Wheaton** from the forest village of **New Eismil**. They tell the party about a missing girl: **Ayla**. Dreamwulf catches her scent from a piece of clothing and it appears to be leading far to the north. Mace also reveals that there is a village of Kobolds in the forest.
- They find a **Driftglobe** 
- They come across a raging river with a sabotaged ferry. They overcome this obstacle by using Rowan-Croc as a private ferry. They repair the ferry while they're at it.
- They find an ancient arcane **Monument of Power**. Rowan touches it and gains the ability to cast a Level 1 spell without spending a spell slot once, before they take a Long Rest.
- An Owlbear Cave with a fresh carcass, which they quickly skin and take the flesh from to give their **Quartermaster** a **+1 bonus** on their next Travel Check
- They come across a large lake: **Loch Fallich** - the waters are unnaturally dark and there is a noted absence of wildlife. They also find an obscured cave nearby that serves as a safe haven to take a **Long Rest**!
- From a vantage point, they see a lot of creatures in the far distance moving towards and around a specific clearing in the woods. It seems like there is something in the middle of the clearing but they're unable to make out what it is. They gather it's around 4 days traveling.
- After Loch Fallich, they cross the last bit towards the Felwarren. Once again they come across a **Monument of Power** that gives Mariun the ability to maximize her Hit Dice when healing in one Short Rest.

After 8 days of traveling, the party nears the **Felwarren**. The nature in this area seems to shy away, with plant life sparse and withering away and an acrid, sour smell pervading the air. When they sneak closer by, they see a large cave opening in the mountains and a putrid smell of rot and decay wafts from within. Hanging around this area, they see **6 Gnolls** and **12 Abyssal Hyenas**...

### Items gained
>[!tip]+ Driftglobe
>This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can command it to emanate light equivalent to that of the [Light](https://5e.tools/spells.html#light_xphb) or [Daylight](https://5e.tools/spells.html#daylight_xphb) spell (your choice). Once used, the Daylight effect can't be used again until the next dawn.
>
>You can issue another command as a [Magic](https://5e.tools/actions.html#magic_xphb) action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.
