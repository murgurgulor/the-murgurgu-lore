### Events
The party continues on, following the kobolds' map to a cave. Rowan turns into a spider to scout ahead, leaving a webby trail behind. After tracking the kobolds through the various tunnels they come upon a great cavern. In there, they see a group of kobolds nervously advancing on a Bronze Dragon Wyrmling. Their leader, a kobold with fake wings mounted to her back, seems to be trying to touch the creature.

The party quickly devises a cunning plan. With the kobolds distracted, Spider-Rowan will spin a harness for Mariun and carry her in along the ceiling. Meanwhile Nun and Betsy will head towards a ledge where stalacgncnguhs will provide good cover. Unfortunately Betsy breaks the stealth with a cry of slight discomfort of having tread on a pointy rock. 

Mariun drops from the harness in a sick flip and obliterates a kobold, while Spider-Rowan entangles the kobold leader in a web. Nun snipes off another kobold as well, and Betsy throws up a cunning illusory wall to hide behind. Then, the dragon roars in anger and takes flight, circling back and heaving a powerful Lightning Breath at several kobolds and Mariun. A three-way fight erupts, in which the kobold leader proves herself to be magical as she flings orbs of fire to Spider-Rowan. The kobolds fight a losing battle, however, and any fleeing kobolds are swiftly taken care off with Mariun striking down the leader with the oily black blade of Greyscorn's Halberd. Mysteriously, flames erupt from the kobold leader's left shoulder as she is downed.

Meanwhile, Spider-Rowan and the dragon are engaged in a grappling match. Spider-Rowan brings the dragon down to a more reachable level and everyone starts pelting the dragon with ranged weaponry. With a final squawk, the dragon dies. The party spares no time and immediately starts looting the kobolds and skinning the dragon for parts. Afterwards they inspect the kobold leader's body and find a strange sigil scorched into her left shoulder. Nun copies it on paper. Betsy collects all the kobold ears.

Making their way back to Eskel, they interrupt the mayor's bedtime ritual to show him the spoils of their labour. He convinces them to come back the next day. The party meets up with Terrilick in their inn and celebrates with drink and revelry. The next morning the party is hailed as the Heroes of Eskel and they receive their reward. They leave town in a parade.

The travel to Caol Arrad takes 11 more days, which pass by uneventfully. One night Rowan shares an intimate story of how she can't transform her equipment along when she turns into a cat. The party is ordered to grab her belongings along in such an occassion. Mariun has recurring dreams of a voice telling her that they know that she'll do what must be done, and that they'll help her.

---
The party finally arrives in Caol Arrad, a bay city situated between two rivers. The city is built in tiers and on every tier a canal has been dug between the two rivers. A multitude of small waterfalls drop between tiers and give the city a magical feel when the sun shines on the spray of droplets. Hence the city's nickname: The City of Glittering Dusk.

Terrilick thanks the crew for their service and pays them a handsome fee. He goes off to peddle his pillows but not before Nun's new little eight-legged friends manage to sneak one off his cart. After stealing the party resolves to scamming and they find a fancy jewelry store proprieted by Jon Batcock. They peddle their dragon parts for a handsome price, though Jon seems extremely pleased with this deal.

Next they look for an inn, asking random passersby for advice. They find a fatal flaw in the Wrestling Werebear's vegan menu and end up settling on the Marinating Mermaid. On their way there, Rowan spies some people looking at her and whispering. It turns out they're followers from the Church of the Dragon - Draconites - and are in awe of her scaling. Rowan asks if anyone similar to her has been by recently but they don't know, and refer Rowan to their Elder in the church. Nun goes shopping and after failing to barter buys 40 Barbed Arrows.

That evening in the inn, Nun overhears some gossip about the country's Ruling Council. Apparently two of the three councilors don't like the third one, someone named Cadhla. Apparently this Cadhla joined the Council 4 years prior and hails from a province with civil unrest. Rowan ends the night by turning into a cat and sneaking into the Church of the Dragon. She finds the church's elder, an old golden dragonborn with tiny spectacles, in one of the backrooms writing weird dragon fanfiction with dubious self-inserts.

>[!tip]+ Asainn's Political Situation
>The country of Asainn consists of three provinces: Cridhen, Talagar and Glen Fior. This last province only joined the country some 95 years ago, and under dubious circumstances. As a result, the people from Glen Fior have a healthy distrust of the government and this has led to some civil unrest over the years.
>
>In order to have all the provinces equally represented in the government, each province delegates one Councilor to the Ruling Council.
>- Cridhen is represented by Lasair Gordan, an elderly elf woman who is also the current leader of the council. She has been on the council for 24 years.
>- Talagar is represented by Maelon Baughn, a gruff dwarf man with a history in the military. He has been on the council for 11 years.
>- Glen Fior is represented by Vello Cadhla, a young and free-spirited human man. He has been on the council for 4 years.

The next day, the group heads to the Council's Tower - a large hexagonal tower that once served as a military watch tower. It has a brutalist architecture that has been covered with with expensive rugs, banners and furniture. They sign in and ascend the long stairs to the top floor where the Council resides. In the waiting room they meet two gnomes who want to peddle their concept of Pineapple Armor for the dragon effort. They also briefly talk to three half-orcs, one of which is named Riqardo, who have also signed up for the Hinterlands War Effort. They appear to have dubious motives and qualities.

Finally it's the party's turn. They enter the Council's Chamber: a large open space with great glass windows on every wall. Six guards are stationed in this room. Behind a large desk the councilors are seated. Lasair Gordan does the talking and inquires about the motives, skills and talents of every party member, which they answer acceptably. There is some smalltalk about Terrilick's pillows.

After the end of the incredibly boring and formal interview, Councilor Vello Cadhla suddenly swoops in with his bright green robes and gives heartfelt words of thanks and appreciation to the party. Cadhla reprimands the other councilors for not being appreciative of the people who come to serve their country, and they begrudgingly give thanks to the party as well.

The party leaves the tower with their contracts and instructions to present themselves to General Maeve Eswein in Dun Ballantein. They also get a ticket to travel on The Sandspear, a ship sailing to Port Hawis in 2 days!
