A list of the NPCs you've met so far.

**Terrilick Gumsby**: Halfling Merchant and your current patron. He has employed you as guards for the trip down to Caol Arrad. He is a bit weird about his pillows but apparently they're of great quality.

**Dooghan Maculney**: Nervous and sweaty mayor of Eskel, who has given you the quest of hunting down the remaining Kobolds.

**Lasair Gordan**: Elderly Elven woman and one of Asainn's three councilors, from the province of Cridhen. Very stoic and down-to-business.

**Maelon Baughn**: Gruff Dwarven man and one of Asainn's three councilors, from the province of Talagar. You haven't heard him speak a word so far.

**Vello Cadhla**: Young and jovical human man and one of Asainn's three councilors, from the province of Glen Fior. Very warm and welcoming.

**Riqardo**: Laidback half-orc of unknown relevance to the rest of the story.
