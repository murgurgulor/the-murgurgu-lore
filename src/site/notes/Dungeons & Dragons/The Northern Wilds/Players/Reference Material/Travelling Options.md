**Wayfinder**
Success DC+4: You stay on track and choose one of the following: You make a Discovery; You find a safe way around any Danger ahead.
Partial Success (DC+4): You stay on track.
Failure: You lose your way, you either run into unexpected danger (but maybe the Scout has the drop on it), or you lose time and resources.

**Scout**
Success: Choose two of the following: You find out if there's a Danger ahead, and if there is you get the drop on it; You find a beneficial terrain (shortcut, shelter, high ground); You make a Discovery.
Partial Success (DC-3): Choose one from the above.
Failure: You don't find anything, and if there's danger ahead you don't get the drop on it.

**Quartermaster**
Success: You find enough water, food and comfortable shelter to have a feast. Describe what you've cooked, and everyone who says "Yum!" and licks their lips gets Advantage on their next d20 roll.
Partial Success (DC-3): You find enough water and food to keep everyone going.
Failure: Choose 1: You don't find enough food and water and everyone gets Disadvantage on their next d20 roll, or you do find enough resources but you get into some trouble.

**Sentry**
Success: Choose two: You get the drop on any Danger the Scout might have missed; You make a Discovery; You boost morale or help out someone else with their task: choose one ally and increase their Travel result up one category (you can choose this option twice)
Partial Success (DC-3): Choose one from the above.
Failure: You just wander along daydreaming and don't help anyone.

**Making Camp**
After making camp, choose on a watch roster. The DM will choose one PC to roll a d6 during their watch. The chance of a nightly event depends on the danger level of the terrain.
