# What is a Perilous Journey?
A Perilous Journey means traveling through a hostile environment that holds some form of danger to you. Traveling over a road in a peaceful kingdom is generally safe and not considered a Perilous Journey. Sure, you might run into bandits or other dangers on these roads, but that would be an exception. The environment itself is not hostile.

When you make a Perilous Journey, you venture into an environment that *is* hostile to you in some way, and encountering dangers and challenges is to be expected. A Perilous Journey doesn't necessarily mean you travel through wilderness; infiltrating a hostile nation can also be a Perilous Journey.

When you undertake a Perilous Journey you make preparations and take measures to avoid or mitigate danger, but you also have to be prepared to face them.


# How do we Undertake a Perilous Journey?
## Pointcrawls
There are several ways to mechanically simulate traveling. One of the most well-known ones is the Hexcrawl. In a Hexcrawl, the environment you travel in is divided in 6-mile-wide hexagons. Each hexagon is a part of the environment and has a certain biome, landmarks and possible dangers. The party travels from Hex to Hex, deciding their path frequently and facing what comes in every Hex.

A Pointcrawl is similar, but slightly different. Instead of moving from one Hex to another, you travel from one landmark or point of interest to the other. Unlike the Hexcrawl, the distance between these points is not always the same. Some points might be separated by half a day's travel, and others might be separated by a full week of traveling. Often, one or more routes can lead to the same goal destination but each route offers a choice: do you take the safer but slower route, or the route that is more easy to navigate but that holds more dangers?

To start a Pointcrawl, you need to know your current location and your goal destination. Your goal destination can be a specific place on the map, if you know of it, or a general direction such as 'through the forest and then around 6 miles west of the jagged peaks'. When you've noted both the start and end of your journey, you can also choose what route to take (if it seems there is more than one viable route).

If the land you're traveling in is unknown to you, there might be other landmarks or points of interest along the route you're taking. When you're traveling, you will come across these points. This breaks up the travel sequence and either provides interesting features or hints of information, or they might provide dangers and challenges to overcome. Once you've come across such a point, you can mark it on your map and refer back to it later.


## Preparing for a Perilous Journey
It's assumed that you all make general preparations for your trip. You stock up on rations, water skins, camping supplies, etc. Everything you might need for general travel. If you want to prepare specific things, however, that is also possible. You might want to bring a cart to carry more supplies, or you might want to seek out an explorer or scholar to see if they can provide you with more in-depth knowledge on the dangers that you might encounter. You could also procure pack beasts or hirelings to aid in your travel, study the weather, et cetera.

Some of these preparations might simply provide a narrative permission but not mechanically affect your journey. Others might give you Advantage on specific rolls related to the trip, or add landmarks to your map that were previously unknown to you. An appropriate ability check might be warranted for certain preparations.


## Charting the Course
With your map, starting location, and goal destination, you can decide which route your party is going to take. The DM will tell you for each viable route through what terrain it generally is, what the expected **Travel Time** is to reach your goal destination, and any other details that an adventuring party would be able to know. 

If your party is relatively familiar with the environment already, the DM will also let you know what the risk for **Chance Encounters** is along the way. If the land is unknown to you, you can make an **Intelligence (Arcana/History/Nature)** check to learn this information. The skill proficiency you can apply to this check depends on the terrain you're traveling in.


## Making the Perilous Journey
### Dividing Travel Roles
When you have prepared for your trip and charted the course, it's time to start your trip. You start from the starting point on your map, and travel along the route you've chosen towards the goal destination. Along the route, you will encounter other points of interest, either known or unknown to you.

For every trip between two Points on the Pointcrawl, the party needs to divide four different roles amongst each other.
1. **Wayfinder**: The Wayfinder is the party member who is in charge of plotting the course, navigating, and prevent everyone from getting lost.
2. **Scout**: The Scout is the party member who is in charge of going ahead to find safe passages, and who watches out for any dangers that may lie ahead.
3. **Quartermaster**: The Quartermaster is the party member who is in charge of foraging, cooking, setting up camp, packing the bags, and generally making sure everyone is as comfortable as can be.
4. **Sentry**: The Sentry is the party member who takes up the rear. They can do several things, including keeping an eye out for danger, covering the party's tracks, boosting morale, helping others out with their tasks, et cetera.

If there are more than four party members, a role can be taken up multiple times. In this case any rolls will be made with Advantage.

Whenever you arrive at the next point, you can redivide the roles amongst your party members if you wish.

### The Travel Check
Once the roles have been divided, each party member chooses one skill check relating to their role to make a **Travel Check**. This check determines how well you perform your role during this part of the journey. The DC of this check is determined by the terrain you're traveling through. To keep things simple, the DC is the same for every role. Note that the DC does not relate to the dangers a route holds, it just relates to how easy or difficult the terrain is to travel through. You make one Travel Check per crawl between two points.

If your Travel Check meets or beats this DC, you successfully did your part for this leg of the journey. If you fail the Travel Check, however, you fail in your role. This means an unwanted complication might your way, or the trip might take longer than anticipated.
If your Travel Check beats the DC by 4 or more, you have a Resounding Success. This means that you exceed in your role and get provided a bonus.

##### Using Spells or Class Abilities for Travel Checks
Some spells or class abilities might be useful to aid in your Travel Check, but keep in mind that a Travel Check represents your efforts over one or more days. A spell like **Enhance Ability** might give you Advantage on an ability check, but the duration has a maximum of one hour. Casting Enhance Ability therefore won't really affect the way you perform your role that much. **Goodberry**, on the other hand, might provide some benefit as it assures enough sustenance for a day of the travel.

Whether or not a particular spell or class ability can aid you in your Travel Check is up to the DM. If a spell is used, you get a bonus equal to the spell's level for your Travel Check. You can choose to use a spell/ability after you find out whether you make your Travel Check or not. 

There might be spells or abilities that logically would mean an automatic success on a Travel Check. These will be judged on a case-by-case basis.

##### Travel Checks by Travel Role

## Along the Way
While you're undertaking your Perilous Journey, you might encounter dangers, strange phenomena, interesting landmarks, or magnificent secrets. These are divided in two categories: **Chance Encounters** and **Discoveries**.

### Chance Encounters
Perilous Journeys are fraught with dangers and unexpected encounters, but how likely it is to encounter something unexpected can differ per area. The DM rates the **Encounter Chance** of each leg of the Pointcrawl between 1 and 6. When the party rolls their Travel Checks, the DM will roll a number of d6 equal to the **Travel Time** in days. For each d6 where the result is **equal to or below** the Encounter Chance, the party will have a **Chance Encounter** on their way. A **Chance Encounter** can mean you have to face hostile creatures, but it can also mean you encounter friendly or mysterious beings, or a treacherous terrain that you need to traverse. The Scout and Sentry may spot a **Chance Encounter** before you come upon it, so you can prepare to deal with it.

If the **Travel Time** extends because the Wayfinder is not doing their job properly, the DM rolls for the extra days as well. 


### Discoveries
Even though a Perilous Journey might feel like you're constantly in danger, there is also beauty along the way. If a party member makes a **Discovery** as part of their Travel Check, they find a hidden gem along your route. This can be an interesting historical site, arcane ruins from a bygone age, or a peaceful place to rest. Whatever it is, it is in some way useful to the party.

When you make a Discovery, the DM will either tell you what it is, or the DM can ask you to roll on a random table to determine what type of Discovery it is.

---
### Resting
Resting properly is difficult during a Perilous Journey. The constant looming threat of danger and often uncomfortable resting places prevent you from getting a good full rest. This means that during a Perilous Journey, you generally **don't get to take a Long Rest**. You can take Short Rests as usual, and for every night slept you regain one **Hit Dice + your Constitution Modifier** in Hit Points for free, as well as recover a number of **Hit Dice equal to half your level rounded down**. 

If you're lucky, you make a **Discovery** along the way that provides a comfortable and well-hidden place to rest. If you find such an area, you can take a **Long Rest**. You can also mark the place on your map and return later, whenever you need another one.

---
## An Example of Undertaking a Perilous Journey
Barken, Poltar, Neha and Zulom are planning to travel through the wilderness to find an ancient temple. They refer to their maps and choose a goal destination, deep in a dense jungle. They see two different routes: they can either head straight through the jungle (Red), or follow the coastline first before cutting inland (Blue). The DM tells them that the coastal route is probably easier and safer, but will take longer. The jungle route will be shorter, but will be harder to navigate and probably has more dangers as well. They put this in perspective for the players by stating the Coastal route has a **Travel DC** of 12 and a **Travel Time** of 10 days, and the Jungle route has a **Travel DC** of 14 and a **Travel Time** of 6 days. The party, brazen and full of haste, elects to the Jungle Route.

![exmap.png](/img/user/z_attachments/D&D/exmap.png)

Unknown to the party, but known to the DM, is that there's a dangerous patch of land along this route where **Assassin Vines** can strangle the party. This location is shortly before the goal destination: the party will reach it after 4 days.

The DM has determined that the **Encounter Chance** for the Coastal Route is **1**, whereas the **Encounter Chance** for the Jungle Route is **2**. Additionally, the Coastal Route Encounter Table holds more benign challenges, whereas the Jungle Route Encounter Table holds more hostile challenges. The party members could attempt to make an **Intelligence (Nature)** check to see how much of this knowledge they can figure out.

In preparing for the trip, the party seeks out a cartographer to see if they can get a more detailed map. They find one, which gives the **Wayfinder** a +2 bonus on the **Travel Check**. They elect not to take on any pack animals or hirelings. They also attempt to learn more about the wildlife and find a biologist who warns them of dinosaurs that might roam the jungle. Good to know!

It's time to set out. The party divides the **Travel Roles** amongst themselves:
- Neha will be the **Wayfinder**
- Barken will be the **Scout**
- Zulom will be the **Quartermaster**
- Poltar will be the **Sentry**

Everyone looks at the applicable rolls available for their role and chooses one for the Travel Check.
- Neha rolls a **Wisdom (Survival)** for a total of 13. She adds the **+2** bonus from the map to get a total of 15. This beats the DC of 14, so the Wayfinder succeeds.
- Barken rolls a **Dexterity (Stealth)** for a total of 19. He beats the DC by more than 4, so he has a **Resounding Success**
- Zulom rolls a **Constitution (Athletics)** for a meagre 4. He fails.
- Poltar tries to keep everyone happy with a **Charisma (Performance)** check for a total of 16. This is a regular Success meaning they get to choose one of the options. 

After the rolls are made, the DM needs to gather all the information from the outcomes to determine how the trip will play out:
- He first asks the Sentry if he knows what option he will choose. Seeing as a +4 boost won't make Zulom's failure a success, and knowing that the Scout already succeeded, he decides he wants to make a **Discovery**.
- The **Travel Time** hasn't changed from the Wayfinder's success, so the DM knows he needs to roll 6 times for a **Chance Encounter**: 4 times before the party reaches the **Assassin Vines**, and twice from there to the temple.
- The Scout will definitely get the drop on a Chance Encounter, but they can still choose whether they want to get an advantage or make a Discovery. In order to have the Scout make an informed decision, the DM now rolls 4d6 to see if there are any Chance Encounters. The DM gets a 5-4-2-4. The **Encounter Chance** was 2, so the 3rd day of travel will have a **Chance Encounter**.
- The DM tells the Scout that the party will face an encounter, and the Scout elects to get an advantage on dealing with it.
- Finally, the DM asks Zulom how he wants his failure to go. Not wanting to give everyone Disadvantage, he elects to face an unexpected **Chance Encounter**. As this is an unexpected encounter, the Scout does not get the drop on it!

The DM puts everything together:
- The party sets out through the jungle in search of a temple
- Unbeknownst to them, they'll encounter a patch of Assassin Vines on day 4
- On the 3rd day of travel, there is going to be a **Chance Encounter**. The DM rolls on the table and sees that the encounter will be a pack of 1d6 Hungry Raptors.
- Furthermore, there will be another unexpected encounter somewhere along the trip. It doesn't really matter when, so the DM places that one on the second day.
- Finally, the party will make a Discovery. To create a nice scene, the DM will combine this with the unexpected encounter. The DM has no particular plans for a specific Discovery here, so they roll on the Discovery Table and get **A Resting Place**

The travel starts! The DM narrates how the party sets out in the jungle, crossing through thick vegetation and flocks of stingy bugs. He describes how Neha frequently consults the map to keep everyone on track, and how Barken darts ahead from time to time to scout ahead. He describes how Zulom is having trouble finding proper places to sleep in this thick vegetation and their resources quickly dwindle down.

Then, after two full days of travel, the DM describes how Poltar - while helping Zulom forage - stumbles upon an almost hidden cave, covered with branches. This would make an excellent place to have a Long Rest sometimes. They mark the location on their map for future reference, should they venture out into the jungle again. 
Now the Chance Encounter: the DM rolls on the table again and sees that they will face a **Giant Thunder Snake**! The DM describes how Zulom and Poltar suddenly see a pair of yellow eyes in the cave, as the Snake slithers out and attacks them! The party rolls initiative as usual and the narrative zooms in on the combat.

After combat, the trip continues. The narrative zooms out again as the DM describes the rest of their travel. On the 3rd day, the party will encounter a pack of Hungry Raptors. The narrative zooms in and the DM explains how Barken, scouting out ahead, suddenly sees a pack of Hungry Raptors roaming through the jungle. As Barken has chosen to get an advantage on dealing with it, the DM describes how Barken also saw a thick patch of vegetation nearby that would give the party Advantage for sneaking past the raptors. The party still has a choice to either try to Stealth by or attack the Raptors.

However this encounter went, once it's dealt with the narrative zooms out again as the DM continues the journey's narration. 

On the 4th day, the party expects nothing much more to happen: all the Chance Encounters they knew of have taken place already. The DM suddenly zooms the narrative in again as they describe the group coming across a dense patch of vegetation with vines hanging from the trees. He calls for everyone **passive Perception** to notice how the vines seem to undulate slightly, and how there are many small bones on the floor here. A successful **Intelligence (Nature)** check would be required to identify these plants as **Assassin Vines**, and otherwise a successful **Intelligence (Investigation)** check could tell the party that there must be some type of predator around here...

After a harrowing battle against the vines, the party emerges from this patch and marks it on their map as a dangerous place. After tending to their wounds, the DM tells the party they have two more days of travel left. The party can now choose to change their **Travel Roles** up or keep them as they were. Afterwards, everyone rolls a **Travel Check** again and the DM rolls twice more for **Chance Encounters**. Lucky for the party, no one fails and there are no more encounters along the way. The narrative zooms out as the DM speeds over the last two days of traveling, and then zooms in as the party reaches the temple...
