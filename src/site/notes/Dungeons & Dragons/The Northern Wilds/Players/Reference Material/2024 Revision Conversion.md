Follow these steps to update your character to the 2024 revision!

1. You keep all your ability scores and modifiers as they are now.

2. You keep the Skill proficiences, Tool proficiencies, Saving throw proficiencies and Languages learned as they are now.

3. You keep your species and its features if there's not an update in the new rules. If you have a species that does have an update, you switch to the features of the new one. (Specifically this concerns Pieter and Gijs).

4. Everyone gets to choose an Origin Feat (for Gijs: this is on top of the one you get from being Human)

5. Look at the other Feat(s) you already have: if there's an update in the new rules, you switch to the new version. This might increase some of your ability scores (for example the updated Grappler feat now also lets you to increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1). If you don't like the updated version of a Feat, feel free to choose another one instead. If there's not an update of a Feat you have in the new rules, you keep it as is. 

6. Look at your new class abilities and spells. Some spells have stayed the same, but some have changed a bit!

7. Create a new character sheet for yourself. You can find the official 2024 sheet [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z6j32y7x3W8jS9epHXsj7VC069S9nJVS/view?usp=drive_link), but feel free to look for a different one if that works better for you!
