A list of the (unusual) items you've obtained so far.

### Weapons
- **Metal Grenade**: A strange metal sphere that you found on a Kobold. It probably does something when thrown.
- **Large Metal Projectile Launcher**: A strange metal tube that has a bola-like object inside. You can probably fire it, but it's so foreign to you that you have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Barbed Arrows (40)**: Barbed Arrows deal 1 extra damage on a hit.

### Magic Items
>[!sc]+ Greyscorn's Halberd
>**Attunement**: No
>This is a magical +1 Halberd with a dark oily blade. You have witnessed strange necrotic energy being sucked into the blade after killing a Goblin.

>[!sc]+ Cloak of Protection
>**Attunement:** Yes (Mariun)
>You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws while you wear this cloak.

>[!sc]+ Cape of the Mountebank
>**Attunement:** No
>While wearing this cape, you can use it to cast Dimension Door as a Magic action once per day. When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke which makes the area Lightly Obscured until the end of your next turn.
>**Dimension Door**: You teleport to a location within 500 feet. You arrive exactly at the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualise, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction. You can teleport one willing creature you touch with you. If you arrive in a space occupied by another creature or filled with objects, you take 4d6 Force damage and the teleportation failes.

>[!sc]+ Bow of Duplicity
>**Attunement:** Yes (Betsy)
>This is a magical +1 Longbow. The Bow has 3 charges. When you make an attack with the bow, you can expend a charge before you make the attack roll to duplicate the arrow you're about to shoot. You choose two different targets within 30 ft. of each other and make an attack roll. The result is used for both targets. If the attack hits both targets, you roll damage once and apply it to both. Any magical effects that affect the attack is duplicated as well (such as Ensnaring Strike or Smite). The Bow regains all charges every day at dawn. 

>[!sc]+ Enspelled Chain Shirt (Jump)
>**Attunement**: Yes (Nun)
>This Chain Shirt has 6 charges. You can expend 1 charge in order to cast the Jump spell. The armor regains 1d6 charges at dawn.
>**Jump**: As a Bonus Action you can touch one creature. Once on each of their turns for 1 minute, that creature can jump 30 feet by expending 10 feet of movement.
