A list of the (unusual) items you've obtained so far.

- **Greyscorn's Halberd**: a +1 Halberd with a dark oily metal blade.
- **Metal Grenade**: A strange metal sphere that you found on a Kobold. It probably does something when thrown.
- **Large Metal Projectile Launcher**: A strange metal tube that has a bola-like object inside. You can probably fire it, but it's so foreign to you that you have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Dullaleaf Poison** (4 doses): Apply poison through injury or ingestion. The target makes a Constitution Saving Throw DC 12, and on a fail the target has Disadvantage on all Wisdom ability checks and Wisdom Saving Throws for the coming hour. 
- **Barbed Arrows (40)**: Barbed Arrows deal 1 extra damage on a hit.
- **Sloth's Mucus (3 doses)**: Apply poison through injury or ingestion. The target makes a Constitution Saving Throw DC 12, and on a fail the target has Disadvantage on all Dexterity ability checks and Dexterity saving throws for the coming hour.
- **Cold Iron Ore**, enough to make 10 pieces of ammunition, or half of what's needed to create a Light bladed weapon
