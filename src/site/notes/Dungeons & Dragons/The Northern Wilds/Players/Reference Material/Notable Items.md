A list of the (unusual) items you've obtained so far.

- **Greyscorn's Halberd**: a +1 Halberd with a dark oily metal blade.
- **Metal Grenade**: A strange metal sphere that you found on a Kobold. It probably does something when thrown.
- **Large Metal Projectile Launcher**: A strange metal tube that has a bola-like object inside. You can probably fire it, but it's so foreign to you that you have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Dullaleaf Poison** (4 doses): Apply poison through injury or ingestion. The target makes a Constitution Saving Throw DC 12, and on a fail the target has Disadvantage on all Wisdom ability checks and Wisdom Saving Throws for the coming hour.
