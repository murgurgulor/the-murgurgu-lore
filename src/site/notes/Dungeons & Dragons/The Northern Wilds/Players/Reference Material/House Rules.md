The following rules are in addition to the Rules As Written (RAW)

# General
- You get an extra Feat at character creation. You can ignore the level requirement but you can't choose a Fighting Style Feat.
- Everyone starts the session with Heroic Inspiration. 
- If you roll for Hit Points on level-up, you can also use Heroic Inspiration to gain Advantage on the HP roll if you still have Heroic Inspiration at that time.

---
### Rest and recovery
- A **Short Rest** functions as usual, taking 30-60 minutes of in-game time.
- A **Long Rest** only happens when you take a full night's rest in a **peaceful environment**.
- If you take a full night's rest in a non-peaceful environment, you gain the following benefits:
	- All the benefits from a **Short Rest**
	- You recover Hit Points equal to **1/2 your level (rounded down) in Hit Dice + your Consitution modifier**
		- As a lvl 5 Fighter, you would heal 2d10+Con mod HP for free: Your Hit Point Die as a Fighter is a d10, half your level is 2,5 which rounded down is 2.
	- You recover **1/4 your level (rounded down) in Hit Die** for your pool.

# Downtime Projects
Characters can train in specific areas during their downtime in order to get new abilities or bonuses. These mechanics are focused on custom abilities and bonuses and not on learning specific Feats or Skill Proficiencies, although we can always see how to make it work if a Feat of Proficiency *is* your goal.

If you want to undertake a Downtime Project, describe what your Project is in a simple sentence. Based on that description we can work out together what kind of mechanical benefit you'll get from completing the project.

It's possible that your Project might have more than one possible goal. Your Project can then be divided into Stages. Attaining each Stage provides a new benefit, but is also harder to achieve than earlier ones - initial learning might be fast, but any additional learning or practice comes at a slower incremental speed.

Once you've stated your Downtime Project, you get to work on it during any in-game downtime in which it's reasonable you have enough time and resources to devote your time to it. Practicing something in the evenings of an adventuring day doesn't provide this focus and dedication. At the end of the Downtime, you make a **Progress Roll** to see how far you've developed your project. This is a straight Ability check. The specific Ability you roll for depends on the type of Project. If you're working with someone else on a single Project, one of you makes the check but they roll with Advantage.
- If you're working on your offensive or defensive skills, you probably roll **STR**, **DEX** or **CON**
- If you're working on creating machinery, items, a special magical ritual or finding information, you probably roll **INT** or **WIS**
- If you're working on making connections and friends in high places, you probably roll **CHA**

Of course there are many more types of Projects that can call for a specific Ability roll, but this is a general guideline.
Depending on the result of your **Progress Roll**, you get **Progress Points**:

| Progress Roll | Progress Points |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| <10           | 0               |
| 10-14         | 1               |
| 15-19         | 2               |
| 20+           | 3               |

How many Progress Points are needed for a project depends on whether it's a first/single stage Project, or a later stage in a larger Project. Particularly hard or lengthy projects might take more Progress Points at the DM's discretion. The following table is a general guideline.

| Project Stage     | Progress Points Required for Completion |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Single/First      | 3                                       |
| Second            | 5                                       |
| Any beyond second | Previous Requirement +1                 |

You can visualise your progress in a Project on your character sheet by drawing a number of checkboxes needed for completion. You could also draw a clock instead and divide it into equal segments.


### Example
**Rowan** and **Mariun** want to work on improving their combined combat prowess, where Rowan serves as a mount for Mariun. Their Project is described as "We want to become better at fighting when Mariun is riding Rowan."

This is quite a broad Project, so the DM proposes a multistage project with a small list of features they can choose from each time they complete a Stage:

- +1 on attack rolls when fighting with your companion (can be chosen multiple times)
- You can use your companion's AC instead of your own
- When one of you gets hit, you can choose to split the damage halfway between your and your companion
- When you both need to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, you can use the result of your companion's dice roll if it's higher than yours
- When rolling Initiative, the companions get to choose on whose Initiative Count they both are placed

At the end of the Downtime, they get to make a Progress Roll. The DM allows them to either roll STR or DEX for this check. As they're working together on this project, they decide that Mariun will make the roll and she'll get to make the roll with Advantage. Mariun rolls a total of 18, so they get 2 Progress Points. Not enough to complete the project, but they'll only need to roll for a 10 or higher on the next Downtime to finish this stage and choose one of the benefits.

If they want to improve their abilties further after this, they'll have to get 5 Progress Points before they get to choose another feature of the list.

# Combat
###### Initiative
Initiative and Turn Order are arranged in the following way:
- At the start of the session, one of the players is assigned as the **Scribe**. It's the Scribe's responsibility to keep track of the Initiative Order in combat, call out who's turn is up and whose turn will come after.
- The **Environment** is always the top of the Initiative Order. This is a turn in which any **Lair Actions** or environmental effects take place.
- The DM determines the opponents' Initiative by taking their **Passive Initiative**, and applying a +5 modifier for Boss monsters and a -5 modifier for Minion monsters. The DM groups opponents together with ideally no more than 2 Initiative counts for the opponents.
- At the start of combat, the DM declares the opponents' Initiative Counts to the Scribe
- Then, each player rolls **Initiative** as normal. The Scribe then groups characters together based on whether they're **Before the Opponents**, **In Between Opponents** or **After Opponents**
+ The Scribe notes down the Initiative Order per groups of characters and opponents.
- When a Group has their turn, the players/monsters who belong to the Group can take their turns in whatever order they want, or even simultaneously if they have a strategy that relies on working together.

**Example**
Combat start and the players roll their initiatives, coming up with 7, 11, 16, 21
There are some regular monsters and some weak minions, both with a +2 initiative modifier. The regular monsters get grouped and go at count 12, the minions take a -5 penalty on their Initiative and all go at count 7. This results in the following turn order:

| Turn Order | Participants     |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1          | Environment      |
| 2          | Player 16 and 21 |
| 3          | Regular Monsters |
| 4          | Player 7 and 11  |
| 5          | Minions          |

When the turn of Player 16 and Player 21 comes up, they can decide who takes their turn first. They can change this choice every round. They can also choose to take their turn together, allowing them to take their movement and actions at the same time.


###### Cinematic Advantage
If you describe how you're using something in the environment to make a cool attack, you can ask for Cinematic Advantage. If you succeed on an appropriate ability check set by the DM, you get a **+2 Bonus** on that attack. However, if you fail the ability check you suffer a negative consequence, such as a **-2 Penalty** on the attack roll or falling prone. This penalty is declared before the check is made.

 **Example** 
 A rogue wants to attack an evil wizard and asks if they can get Cinematic Advantage by swinging on a chandelier while they attack. The DM offers the player a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check DC 12 to pull this off, with the risk of missing the target altogether and falling prone on a failure. If the rogue succeeds on this check, they roll their attack roll with a +2 bonus. If the check is failed, they don't get to make their attack and they fall prone near the wizard. The rogue can make an informed decision, based on their skill in Acrobatics, whether they want to take the risk or not.

###### Minor Tweaks
- **Retreat**: If combat is not going well, every player can discuss a possible Retreat on their turn. On any PCâ€™s turn, any player can propose that all the characters retreat from the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen party members away with them. This comes at a cost to the story: the bad guys will be able to make a major advancement against your goals!
- **Bonus Action Potions**: Potions can be ingested as either a Bonus Action or an Action. If you use a Bonus Action and the potion calls for a roll, you roll as usual. If you use your Action, you take the maximum amount possible for the roll.
- A number of **Combat Maneuvers** are available. You can find a summary of the maneuvers below.

---
## Zone-based Combat
We won't use a gridded map to play out combat. Instead we'll use **Zone-based Combat**.

- If a combat area is large enough it might be divided into several zones. A small area is just a single zone.
- A zone is assumed to be the equivalent of a 30 ft. diameter sphere. To determine how many zones beyond the one you're in an ability or attack can reach, divide the range by 30ft and round down. An attack with a range of 30 ft. can target enemies in your Zone and 1 Zone over. Attacks of 150 ft. can anywhere up to 5 Zones over.
- On your turn, your character can move anywhere within a zone or move from one zone to an adjacent zone. If you have particularly low or high movement speed, you might be able to reach less or further. Difficult Terrain also factors in here on a case-by-case judgement.
- We assume characters are not within threatening reach of an enemy unless they have attacked or were attacked by that enemy with a melee attack.
- We assume characters move and act smartly. They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks.
- Areas of Effect of spells/abilities target a number of creatures as would be logical, guided by the section below.
- The DM will adjudicate specific situations as the come up in gameplay. The decision is based on what makes sense in the situation and will favor the character when possible.

### AoE Targets
Use the following guidelines to roughly determine how many targets you can affect with an AoE effect:
- **Tiny areas**: 1 creature (_cloud of daggers_)
- **Small areas**: 2 creatures (_thunder wave, burning hands_).
- **Large areas**: 4 creatures (_cone of cold, fireball, darkness_).
- **Huge areas**: 8+ creatures/Everyone (_earthquake, circle of death_).
- **Short lines**: 2 creatures (_wall of fire_).
- **Long lines** 3 creatures (_lightning bolt, blade barrier_).

If more detail is required to determine the number of targets, refer to the table below.

| Area                   | Targets (rounded up)                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cone                   | (Size / 10) targets (roughly) in a group |
| Cube/Square            | (Size / 5) targets                       |
| Cylinder/Sphere/Circle | (Radius / 5) targets                     |
| Line                   | (Length / 30) targets in a rough line    |

## Combat Maneuvers

### Movement Maneuvers
On your turn, as part of your movement you can use your **Action** or **Bonus Action** to force your movement through or onto an opponent. When you make these maneuvers, you have to make a **Strength (Athletics)** or **Dexterity (Acrobatics)** check to succeed. The **DC** for this check is **8 + the target's Proficiency Bonus + the target's Strength** (for Overrun) or **Dexterity** (for Climb Onto and Tumble) **modifier**.

---
##### Climb Onto Creature
You can Climb onto a different Creature if it's at least one size larger than you are, if it has an appropriate anatomy that can be climbed, and if you have at least one hand free. 
On a success, you climb on the creature and can move about its body, but this counts as **Difficult Terrain**. 
Attacking the creature while on it gives you **Advantage** on your attack rolls. 
The creature can use their **Action** to try to shake you off on their turn, which you can attempt to avoid with either a **Strength** or **Dexterity Saving Throw** against the same **DC**.

---
##### Overrun/Tumble
When you Overrun or Tumble, you move through an opponent's space rather than around. 
On a success, you can move through the target's space once this turn. 
You have **Advantage** on your roll if you're larger (Overrun) or smaller (Tumble) than the target, and **Disadvantage** for the reverse. 
You still provoke an **Opportunity Attack** if you move out of the targetâ€™s threat range.

---
### Offensive Maneuvers
As part of the **Attack** action, you can make one of these maneuvers against an opponent within your reach. If you can make more than one attack, you can replace one of your attacks with a maneuver. When you make a maneuver against an opponent, they get to make a **Strength** or **Dexterity saving throw** to avoid the effect. The **DC** for this saving throw is **8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier**.

---
##### Disarm
When you Disarm someone, you knock an opponent's weapon or other item they're holding out of their hands. 
On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but the opponent drops the item you targeted. The item then drops to the ground, or you can immediately wield it yourself if you have a free hand available. 
They have **Advantage** on the saving throw if their size is larger than yours, or if they're holding the item with two (or more) hands. They have **Disadvantage** on the saving throw if their size is smaller than yours.

---
##### Grapple
When you Grapple an opponent, you're wrestling with them to keep them where you want 'em. 
You can only grapple an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you, and you need to have at least one hand free. On a failed saving throw, the target gains the **Grappled** condition. This means:
- Their speed drops to 0;
- They have **Disadvantage** on attacks that donâ€™t target you;
- While youâ€™re grappling, you can move the target along with you, but you move at half your speed.

They can escape the Grapple on their turn by using their **Action** to make a **Str (Athletics)** or **Dex (Acrobatics)** roll vs. the same DC. On a success, they break your grapple.

---
##### Shove/Shove Aside
When you Shove an opponent, you either knock them to the ground or 5ft away from you.
You can only shove an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you. On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but you knock them prone or 5ft straight back from you. 
You can also choose to move the opponent to any space within your reach instead of straight back, but they get **Advantage** on the saving throw.
