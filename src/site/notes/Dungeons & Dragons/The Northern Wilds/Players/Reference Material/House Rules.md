The following rules are in addition to the Rules As Written (RAW):
- You get an extra Feat at character creation. You can ignore the level requirement but it you can't choose a Fighting Style Feat.
- Everyone starts the session with Heroic Inspiration. 
- If you roll for Hit Points on level-up, you can also use Heroic Inspiration to gain Advantage on the HP roll if you still have Heroic Inspiration at that time.
- Rest and recovery:
	- A **Short Rest** functions as usual, taking 30-60 minutes of in-game time.
	- A **Long Rest** only happens when you take a full day's rest (= light activities during the day, and a good night's sleep) in a peaceful environment.
	- In between these two, there's a **Medium Rest** which occurs after every night's sleep. After a Medium Rest you get the following:
		- All the benefits from a Short Rest
		- You recover a number of Hit Point Dice equal to half your level rounded up
		- You heal HP equal to a number of Hit Point Dice of half your level (rounded up) + Con modifier. You can spend more Hit Point Dice to heal up more (as in a Short Rest). 
			- For example if you take a Medium Rest as a lvl 5 Fighter, you heal 3d10+Con mod HP for free: Your Hit Point Die as a Fighter is a d10, half your level is 2,5 which rounded up is 3.
- Combat:
	- After Initiative is rolled for combat, you can choose to voluntarily lower your Initiative.
	- **Cinematic Advantage**: If you describe how you're using something in the environment to make a cool attack, you can ask for Cinematic Advantage. If you succeed on an appropriate ability check set by the DM, you get Advantage on that attack. However, if you fail the ability check you suffer a negative consequence, such as Disadvantage on the attack roll or falling prone. This penalty is declared before the check is made.
		- For example: A rogue wants to attack an evil wizard and describes how they're swinging on a chandelier while they attack. The DM offers the player the chance of Cinematic Advantage by making a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check DC 12, with the risk of missing the target altogether and falling prone on a failure. If the rogue succeeds on this check, they roll their attack roll with Advantage. If the check is failed, they don't get to make their attack and they fall prone near the wizard. The rogue can make an informed decision, based on their skill in Acrobatics, whether they want to take the risk or not.
	- **Retreat**: If combat is not going well, every player can discuss a possible Retreat on their turn. On any PC’s turn, any player can propose that all the characters retreat from the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen party members away with them. This comes at a cost to the story: the bad guys will be able to make a major advancement against your goals!
	- If you want to drink a healing potion, you can choose to use a Bonus Action or an Action to do so. If you use a Bonus Action, you roll for the healing as usual. If you use your Action, you gain the maximum amount of healing.
	- A number of Combat Maneuvers are available. You can find a summary of the maneuvers below.
	- If you Counterspell a Counterspell, something strange will happen...


### Zone-based Combat
We won't use a gridded map to play out combat. Instead we'll use Zone-based Combat.

- If a combat area is large enough it might be divided into several zones. A small area is just a single zone.
- On your turn, your character can move anywhere within a zone or move from one zone to an adjacent zone. If you have particularly low or high movement speed, you might be able to reach less or further. Difficult Terrain also factors in here on a case-by-case judgement.
- We assume characters are not within threatening reach of an enemy unless they have attacked or were attacked by that enemy with a melee attack.
- We assume characters move and act smartly. They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks.
- Ranged attacks can hit someone within the same zone or in an adjacent zone. Particularly long range abilities (generally more than 60 feet) can target zones further away if the circumstances allow. 
- If you were attacked by an enemy with a melee attack, we assume you're within 5 feet of that enemy and thus have Disadvantage on ranged attacks. 
- Areas of Effect of spells/abilities target a number of creatures as determined in the section below.
- The DM will adjudicate specific situations as the come up in gameplay. The decision is based on what makes sense in the situation and will favor the character when possible.

##### AoE Targets
Use the following guidelines to roughly determine how many targets you can affect with an AoE effect:
- **Tiny areas**: 1 creature (_cloud of daggers_)
- **Small areas**: 2 creatures (_thunder wave, burning hands_).
- **Large areas**: 4 creatures (_cone of cold, fireball, darkness_).
- **Huge areas**: 8+ creatures/Everyone (_earthquake, circle of death_).
- **Short lines**: 2 creatures (_wall of fire_).
- **Long lines** 3 creatures (_lightning bolt, blade barrier_).

If more detail is required to determine the number of targets, refer to the table below.

| Area                   | Targets (rounded up)                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cone                   | (Size / 10) targets (roughly) in a group |
| Cube/Square            | (Size / 5) targets                       |
| Cylinder/Sphere/Circle | (Radius / 5) targets                     |
| Line                   | (Length / 30) targets in a rough line    |

# Combat Maneuvers

### Movement Maneuvers
On your turn, as part of your movement you can use your **Action** or **Bonus Action** to force your movement through or onto an opponent. When you make these maneuvers, you have to make a **Strength (Athletics)** or **Dexterity (Acrobatics)** check to succeed. The **DC** for this check is **8 + the target's Proficiency Bonus + the target's Strength** (for Overrun) or **Dexterity** (for Climb Onto and Tumble) **modifier**.

---
##### Climb Onto Creature
You can Climb onto a different Creature if it's at least one size larger than you are, if it has an appropriate anatomy that can be climbed, and if you have at least one hand free. 
On a success, you climb on the creature and can move about its body, but this counts as **Difficult Terrain**. 
Attacking the creature while on it gives you **Advantage** on your attack rolls. 
The creature can use their **Action** to try to shake you off on their turn, which you can attempt to avoid with either a **Strength** or **Dexterity Saving Throw** against the same **DC**.

---
##### Overrun/Tumble
When you Overrun or Tumble, you move through an opponent's space rather than around. 
On a success, you can move through the target's space once this turn. 
You have **Advantage** on your roll if you're larger (Overrun) or smaller (Tumble) than the target, and **Disadvantage** for the reverse. 
You still provoke an **Opportunity Attack** if you move out of the target’s threat range.

---
### Offensive Maneuvers
As part of the **Attack** action, you can make one of these maneuvers against an opponent within your reach. If you can make more than one attack, you can replace one of your attacks with a maneuver. When you make a maneuver against an opponent, they get to make a **Strength** or **Dexterity saving throw** to avoid the effect. The **DC** for this saving throw is **8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier**.

---
##### Disarm
When you Disarm someone, you knock an opponent's weapon or item they're holding out of their hands. 
On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but the opponent drops an item they're holding. The item drops to the ground, or you can immediately wield it yourself if you have a free hand available. 
They have **Advantage** on the saving throw if their size is larger than yours, or if they're holding the item with two (or more) hands. They have **Disadvantage** on the saving throw if their size is smaller than yours.

---
##### Grapple
When you Grapple an opponent, you're wrestling with them to keep them where you want 'em. 
You can only grapple an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you, and you need to have at least one hand free. On a failed saving throw, the target gains the **Grappled** condition. This means:
- Their speed drops to 0;
- They have **Disadvantage** on attacks that don’t target you;
- While you’re grappling, you can move the target along with you, but you move at half your speed.

They can escape the Grapple on their turn by using their **Action** to make a **Str (Athletics)** or **Dex (Acrobatics)** roll vs. the same DC. On a success, they break your grapple.

---
##### Shove/Shove Aside
When you Shove an opponent, you either knock them to the ground or 5ft away from you.
You can only shove an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you. On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but you knock them prone or 5ft straight back from you. 
You can also choose to move the opponent to any space within your reach instead of straight back, but they get **Advantage** on the saving throw.
