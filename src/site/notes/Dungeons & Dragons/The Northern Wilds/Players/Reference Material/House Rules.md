The following rules are in addition to the Rules As Written (RAW):
- You get an extra Feat at character creation.
- Everyone gets One Free Inspiration at the start of every session. You can use this Inspiration to give yourself Advantage on a roll, or to reroll a roll you failed. This Free Inspiration doesn't stack: use it or lose it.
- If you roll for Hit Points on level-up, you can also use Inspiration to gain Advantage on the HP roll.
- Rest and recovery:
	- A **Short Rest** functions as usual, taking 30-60 minutes of in-game time.
	- A **Long Rest** only happens when you take a full day's rest in a peaceful environment.
	- In between these two, there's a **Medium Rest** which occurs after a night's sleep. After a Medium Rest you get the following:
		- All the benefits from a Short Rest
		- You recover a number of Hit Dice equal to half your level rounded up
		- You heal HP equal to a number of Hit Die of half your level (rounded up) + Con modifier. You can spend more Hit Dice to heal up more (as in a Short Rest). For example if you take a Medium Rest as a lvl 5 Fighter, you heal 3d10+Con mod HP for free.
- Combat:
	- After Initiative is rolled for combat, you can choose to voluntarily lower your Initiative.
	- **Cinematic Advantage**: If you describe how you're using something in the environment to make a cool move, you can ask for Cinematic Advantage. If you succeed on an appropriate ability check, you'll get to do your action with Advantage. If you fail the ability check, you suffer a negative consequence.
	- **Retreat**: If combat is not going well, every player can discuss a possible Retreat on their turn. On any PC’s turn, any player can propose that all the characters retreat from the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen party members away with them. This comes at a cost to the story: the bad guys will be able to make a major advancement against your goals!
	- We will use the **Weapon Mastery** rules as explained here on pages 2-4: https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/ph-playtest5/owThVp1CESZ1c91y/UA-2023-PH-Playtest5.pdf
		- Specifically, the Ranger and Barbarian get to choose 2 Weapon Masteries that they have access to. Whenever you attack with a weapon that has a Mastery you have access to, you get to apply its effect on a hit. You can change your Weapon Mastery choices after every Long Rest.
	- If you want to drink a healing potion, you can choose to use a Bonus Action or an Action to do so. If you use a Bonus Action, you roll for the healing as usual. If you use your Action, you gain the maximum amount of healing.
	- A number of Combat Maneuvers are available. You can find a summary of the maneuvers below.
	- If you Counterspell a Counterspell, something strange will happen...


### Zone-based Combat
We won't use a gridded map to play out combat. Instead we'll use Zone-based Combat.
- If a combat area is large enough it might be divided into several zones. A small area is a single zone.
- You can use your movement to move anywhere within your zone, or to one other zone. If you have particularly low or high movement speed, you might be able to reach less or further. Difficult Terrain also factors in here on a case-by-case judgement.
- You can attack anyone in your zone or in an adjacent zone over with ranged attacks. Particularly long range abilities can target zones further away.
- If you move within a zone, it's assumed you move tactically to avoid Opportunity Attacks. You only provoke Opportunity Attacks if it's clear you've been engaged with an enemy (as in, they've just attacked you or you've just attacked them in melee range).
- Areas of Effect target a number of creatures as determined in the table below.
- Edge cases or exceptions will be adjudicated as they come up, where the DM will lean to favouring the players.

##### AoE Targets
Use the following guidelines to roughly determine how many targets you can affect with an AoE effect:

| Area                   | Targets (rounded up)                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cone                   | (Size / 10) targets (roughly) in a group |
| Cube/Square            | (Size / 5) targets                       |
| Cylinder/Sphere/Circle | (Radius / 5) targets                     |
| Line                   | (Length / 30) targets in a rough line    |

# Combat Maneuvers

### Movement Maneuvers
##### Climb Onto Creature
If you're fighting a sufficiently large opponent, you can attempt to climb onto that creature by using your **Action** to make a **Str (Athletics)** or **Dex (Acrobatics)** roll  vs. **DC (8+PB+Dex mod)** of the creature. On a success, you climb on the creature and can move about its body, but this counts as **Difficult Terrain**. Attacking the creature while on it gives you **Advantage** on your attack rolls. The creature can try to shake you off on their turn, which you can attempt to avoid with either a **Strength** or **Dexterity Saving Throw** vs. **DC (8+PB+Str/Dex mod)** of the creature.

---
##### Overrun/Tumble
When you want to move past an opponent but there’s no way around them, you can do so by overrunning them or tumbling past them. As an **Action** or **Bonus Action**, make a **Str (Athletics)** (Overrun) or **Dex (Acrobatics)** (Tumble) roll vs. **DC (8+PB+Str/Dex mod** (Overrun/Tumble)**)** of the opponent. On a success, you can move through the target's space once this turn. You have **Advantage** on your roll if you're larger (Overrun) or smaller (Tumble) than the target, and **Disadvantage** for the reverse. You still provoke an **Opportunity Attack** if you move out of the target’s threat.

---
### Offensive Maneuvers
##### Disarm
As part of the **Attack** action, you can attempt to knock a weapon or other item out of your opponent's hand. You make an **Attack** roll vs. **DC (8+PB+Str/Dex mod)** of the creature. On a success, you don't deal damage but the opponent drops the item. You have **Disadvantage** on the Attack roll if you're smaller than the opponent or if the opponent is holding the item with two (or more) hands. You have **Advantage** on the Attack roll if you're larger than the opponent.

---
##### Grapple
As part of the **Attack** action, you can try to Grapple your opponent if they're no more than one size larger than you and you have at least one free hand. They have to make a **Strength** or **Dexterity Saving Throw** vs. **your DC (8+PB+Str mod)**. On a success, the target gains the Grappled condition (it can’t move anymore and has **Disadvantage** on attacks that don’t target you). It can escape the Grapple by using its **Action** to make a **Str (Athletics)** or **Dex (Acrobatics)** roll vs. the same DC. While you’re grappling, you can move the target along with you but you move at half speed.

---
##### Shove/Shove Aside
As part of the **Attack** action you can attempt to shove your target, either knocking them prone or 5ft away from you, provided they're no more than one size larger than you. They have to make a **Strength** or **Dexterity Saving Throw** vs. **your DC (8+PB+Str mod)**. On a success, you either knock the target prone or 5ft away from you. If you choose to move the target to any space within your reach instead of straight back, they get **Advantage** on the saving throw.
