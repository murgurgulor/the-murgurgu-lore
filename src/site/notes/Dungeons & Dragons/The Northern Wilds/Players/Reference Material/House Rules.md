The following rules are in addition to the Rules As Written (RAW)

# General
- You get an extra Feat at character creation. You can ignore the level requirement but you can't choose a Fighting Style Feat.
- Everyone starts the session with Heroic Inspiration. 
- If you roll for Hit Points on level-up, you can also use Heroic Inspiration to gain Advantage on the HP roll if you still have Heroic Inspiration at that time.

---
### Rest and recovery
- A **Short Rest** functions as usual, taking 30-60 minutes of in-game time.
- A **Long Rest** only happens when you take a full night's rest in a **peaceful environment**.
- If you take a full night's rest in a non-peaceful environment, you gain the following benefits:
	- All the benefits from a **Short Rest**
	- You recover Hit Points equal to **1/2 your level (rounded down) in Hit Dice + your Consitution modifier**
		- As a lvl 5 Fighter, you would heal 2d10+Con mod HP for free: Your Hit Point Die as a Fighter is a d10, half your level is 2,5 which rounded down is 2.
	- You recover **1/4 your level (rounded down) in Hit Die** for your pool.

# Combat
###### Staggered Side Initiative
Initiative and Turn Order are arranged in the following way:
- At the start of combat, each player rolls **Initiative**
- The DM determines the monsters' **Passive Initiative**, with a +5 modifier for Boss monsters and a -5 modifier for Minion monsters, ideally having no more than 2 Initiative counts for the monster's side.
- The DM shares the monsters' Initiative counts with the players, and groups the players according to their Initiative in relation to to monster's count. Any ties go to the players. This results in no more than 3 groups for the players (Before monsters, in between monster, after monsters).
- When a Group has their turn, the players/monsters who belong to the group can take their movement and actions simultaneously

**Example**
Combat start and the players roll their initiatives, coming up with 3, 7, 16, 21
There are some regular monsters and some minions, both with a +2 initiative modifier. The regular monsters get grouped and go at count 12, the minions get grouped and go at count 7. This results in the following turn order:

| Turn Order | Participants     |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1          | Player 16 and 21 |
| 2          | Regular Monsters |
| 3          | Player 7         |
| 4          | Minions          |
| 5          | Player 3         |

###### Cinematic Advantage
If you describe how you're using something in the environment to make a cool attack, you can ask for Cinematic Advantage. If you succeed on an appropriate ability check set by the DM, you get a **+2 Bonus** on that attack. However, if you fail the ability check you suffer a negative consequence, such as a **-2 Penalty** on the attack roll or falling prone. This penalty is declared before the check is made.

 **Example** 
 A rogue wants to attack an evil wizard and asks if they can get Cinematic Advantage by swinging on a chandelier while they attack. The DM offers the player a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check DC 12 to pull this off, with the risk of missing the target altogether and falling prone on a failure. If the rogue succeeds on this check, they roll their attack roll with a +2 bonus. If the check is failed, they don't get to make their attack and they fall prone near the wizard. The rogue can make an informed decision, based on their skill in Acrobatics, whether they want to take the risk or not.

###### Minor Tweaks
- **Retreat**: If combat is not going well, every player can discuss a possible Retreat on their turn. On any PC’s turn, any player can propose that all the characters retreat from the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen party members away with them. This comes at a cost to the story: the bad guys will be able to make a major advancement against your goals!
- **Bonus Action Potions**: Potions can be ingested as either a Bonus Action or an Action. If you use a Bonus Action and the potion calls for a roll, you roll as usual. If you use your Action, you take the maximum amount possible for the roll.
- A number of **Combat Maneuvers** are available. You can find a summary of the maneuvers below.

---
## Zone-based Combat
We won't use a gridded map to play out combat. Instead we'll use **Zone-based Combat**.

- If a combat area is large enough it might be divided into several zones. A small area is just a single zone.
- A zone is assumed to be the equivalent of a 30 ft. diameter sphere. To determine how many zones beyond the one you're in an ability or attack can reach, divide the range by 30ft and round down. An attack with a range of 30 ft. can target enemies in your Zone and 1 Zone over. Attacks of 150 ft. can anywhere up to 5 Zones over.
- On your turn, your character can move anywhere within a zone or move from one zone to an adjacent zone. If you have particularly low or high movement speed, you might be able to reach less or further. Difficult Terrain also factors in here on a case-by-case judgement.
- We assume characters are not within threatening reach of an enemy unless they have attacked or were attacked by that enemy with a melee attack.
- We assume characters move and act smartly. They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks.
- Areas of Effect of spells/abilities target a number of creatures as would be logical, guided by the section below.
- The DM will adjudicate specific situations as the come up in gameplay. The decision is based on what makes sense in the situation and will favor the character when possible.

### AoE Targets
Use the following guidelines to roughly determine how many targets you can affect with an AoE effect:
- **Tiny areas**: 1 creature (_cloud of daggers_)
- **Small areas**: 2 creatures (_thunder wave, burning hands_).
- **Large areas**: 4 creatures (_cone of cold, fireball, darkness_).
- **Huge areas**: 8+ creatures/Everyone (_earthquake, circle of death_).
- **Short lines**: 2 creatures (_wall of fire_).
- **Long lines** 3 creatures (_lightning bolt, blade barrier_).

If more detail is required to determine the number of targets, refer to the table below.

| Area                   | Targets (rounded up)                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cone                   | (Size / 10) targets (roughly) in a group |
| Cube/Square            | (Size / 5) targets                       |
| Cylinder/Sphere/Circle | (Radius / 5) targets                     |
| Line                   | (Length / 30) targets in a rough line    |

## Combat Maneuvers

### Movement Maneuvers
On your turn, as part of your movement you can use your **Action** or **Bonus Action** to force your movement through or onto an opponent. When you make these maneuvers, you have to make a **Strength (Athletics)** or **Dexterity (Acrobatics)** check to succeed. The **DC** for this check is **8 + the target's Proficiency Bonus + the target's Strength** (for Overrun) or **Dexterity** (for Climb Onto and Tumble) **modifier**.

---
##### Climb Onto Creature
You can Climb onto a different Creature if it's at least one size larger than you are, if it has an appropriate anatomy that can be climbed, and if you have at least one hand free. 
On a success, you climb on the creature and can move about its body, but this counts as **Difficult Terrain**. 
Attacking the creature while on it gives you **Advantage** on your attack rolls. 
The creature can use their **Action** to try to shake you off on their turn, which you can attempt to avoid with either a **Strength** or **Dexterity Saving Throw** against the same **DC**.

---
##### Overrun/Tumble
When you Overrun or Tumble, you move through an opponent's space rather than around. 
On a success, you can move through the target's space once this turn. 
You have **Advantage** on your roll if you're larger (Overrun) or smaller (Tumble) than the target, and **Disadvantage** for the reverse. 
You still provoke an **Opportunity Attack** if you move out of the target’s threat range.

---
### Offensive Maneuvers
As part of the **Attack** action, you can make one of these maneuvers against an opponent within your reach. If you can make more than one attack, you can replace one of your attacks with a maneuver. When you make a maneuver against an opponent, they get to make a **Strength** or **Dexterity saving throw** to avoid the effect. The **DC** for this saving throw is **8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier**.

---
##### Disarm
When you Disarm someone, you knock an opponent's weapon or other item they're holding out of their hands. 
On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but the opponent drops the item you targeted. The item then drops to the ground, or you can immediately wield it yourself if you have a free hand available. 
They have **Advantage** on the saving throw if their size is larger than yours, or if they're holding the item with two (or more) hands. They have **Disadvantage** on the saving throw if their size is smaller than yours.

---
##### Grapple
When you Grapple an opponent, you're wrestling with them to keep them where you want 'em. 
You can only grapple an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you, and you need to have at least one hand free. On a failed saving throw, the target gains the **Grappled** condition. This means:
- Their speed drops to 0;
- They have **Disadvantage** on attacks that don’t target you;
- While you’re grappling, you can move the target along with you, but you move at half your speed.

They can escape the Grapple on their turn by using their **Action** to make a **Str (Athletics)** or **Dex (Acrobatics)** roll vs. the same DC. On a success, they break your grapple.

---
##### Shove/Shove Aside
When you Shove an opponent, you either knock them to the ground or 5ft away from you.
You can only shove an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you. On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but you knock them prone or 5ft straight back from you. 
You can also choose to move the opponent to any space within your reach instead of straight back, but they get **Advantage** on the saving throw.
