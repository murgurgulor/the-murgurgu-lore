The following is a quick procedure to structure crawling through dungeons.

>[!sc] Crawling Procedure
>Time is measured in **Dungeon Turns**. One Dungeon Turn is 10 minutes. 
>Every Dungeon Turn:
>1. The DM checks for any **Wandering Encounter**.
>2. The players state what actions they want to take (travel through **Passageways**, explore a **Room of Interest**, set up an ambush, etc.), rolling any dice if required.
>3. The DM describes what happens, and if a Wandering Encounter occurs it will be resolved.
>4. The Dungeon Turn ends, with the time elapsed being checked against spell or effect durations, light sources, et cetera.

# Time spent Crawling
Time in a Dungeon is measured in **Dungeon Turns**. A Dungeon Turn is 10 minutes, so there are 6 Dungeon Turns in an hour.
- Exploring and searching a Room of Interest takes 1 Dungeon Turn. Each player character can undertake one task during this Dungeon Turn.
- The time required traveling through Passageways is measured in Dungeon Turns.
- Wandering Encounters can occur once per Dungeon Turn. The chance of a Wandering Encounter occurring relies on the specific nature of the Dungeon, as well as whether or not the Inhabitants are alerted to any danger.
- A combat encounter is assumed to take at least one Dungeon Turn to complete, including time to rest, regroup, clean weapons, bind wounds, and so on, afterwards.

# Dungeon Composition
A Dungeon consist of the following elements:
- **Rooms of Interest**: These are areas that are of interest to the party, either because of their content or because of their lay-out. Rooms of Interest can be explored, searched, and otherwise interacted with. Two Rooms of Interest are either directly connected to each other, or connected by Passageways. Rooms of Interest are usually occupied by Inhabitants. Empty Rooms of Interest may still be home to a Wandering Encounter.
- **Passageways**: These connect Rooms of Interest, and can range from long hallways to collections of smallers rooms and areas that don't hold anything of interest to the party. They require time to traverse, and cursory exploration of these areas while traversing doesn't turn up anything useful or valuable. Wandering Encounters may occur in Passageways.
- **Inhabitants**: The creatures that call the Dungeon their home, and can be found lurking around. Some of them are keyed to a specific Location, others are Wandering around.

### Dynamic Dungeons
The Dungeon is a living environment. Some of the Inhabitants might be tied to specific Rooms of Interest, but they're by no means static. Dungeon Inhabitants *will* respond to external stimuli even if they occur outside of their keyed location, and take can actions according to their nature and skill in response to your meddling. 

To achieve this, the DM has developed an **Adversary Roster** that lists which Inhabitants are keyed to which Rooms of Interest, but also lists if/how they react to disturbances elsewhere. Naturally, if an Inhabitant leaves their keyed location, the party won't encounter them there anymore.

# Navigating through Dungeons
### Pace
Exploring a dungeon is by default considered to be a slow affair, to account for careful exploration, footing, and checking for traps and obstacles. The average speed by which a party progresses is 300' per Dungeon Turn.

If desired, the party can move through the dungeon at a Fast Pace, progressing 3000' per Dungeon Turn instead. This can only be done in areas that have already been explored, or that have a straightforward lay-out. Any Stealth, Survival, or Perception checks made while traveling at a Fast Pace are made with Disadvantage.

### Lighting
Unless a Dungeon has its own source of illumination, characters will probably want to carry a source of light. Even characters with Darkvision will have a difficult time properly navigating and exploring a fully dark Dungeon.
Having an active light source means you can't Stealth or surprise any Inhabitants, as the light gives you away from a distance.

### Mapping
The players are responsible for mapping their progress through a Dungeon, unless they have somehow procured an accurate map beforehand. The players should designate one of their own as the Mapper.

### Exploring Rooms of Interest
When the party enters a Room of Interest, the DM describes what they immediately see. The DM might also call for a reactive roll - such as Perception or a Knowledge check - to see whether the characters immediately notice things less obvious.

If the party decides to search and explore a Room of Interest, they may make another appropriate check such as Investigation, Perception, or Survival to see what they uncover. Exploring a room takes 1 Dungeon Turn.

##### Taking 10 or 20
If the party is not disturbed by a Wandering Encounter while they explore the room, they can choose to '**Take 10**' on their check. This means that instead of rolling a d20, the result of the check is calculated as if the d20 roll was a 10. This usually means any interesting features are discovered, but any obscure features might be unnoticed. Taking 10 doesn't increase the time it takes to explore a room.

If the party is dedicated and they are willing to invest the time, they can also elect to '**Take 20**' on the check. This means that instead of rolling a d20, the result of the check is calculataed as if the d20 roll was a 20. This usually means you find all features in a room, but this also takes 20 times as long as normal (ie. 20 Dungeon Turns, or 200 minutes).

### Traveling through Passageways
Some dungeons are straightforward and are difficult to get lost in, but some dungeons have Passageways that are veritable mazes of interconnecting hallways, nooks, and crannies, that don't necessarily have to be relevant or make sense.

In difficult to navigate Passageways, the party will need to elect a Wayfinder to find the right paths. When the party heads into a chaotic Passageway for the first time, the Wayfinder makes an appropriate ability check to see if they can keep their way. If they lose their way, the party has to spend 1 Dungeon Turn getting back on track (possible invoking more Wandering Encounters). After a Passageway has been traversed successfully, it's considered 'explored' and won't prompt any future checks. 

If the party is moving at a Fast Pace, this check is made with Disadvantage.

### Stealth
If the environment allows for it, the party can try and stay hidden from Inhabitants. As the pace with which a party explores a dungeon is generally slow this doesn't change the time they spend crawling. If the party is moving at a Fast Pace, the Stealth check is made with Disadvantage.

Stealthing is not possible when:
- The party carries an active light source
- The lay-out of the Dungeon does not allow for effective hiding (at the DM's discretion).
