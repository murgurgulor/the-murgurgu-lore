### Mobility Maneuvers
On your turn, as part of your movement you can use your *Action* or *Bonus Action* to force your movement through or onto an opponent. When you make these maneuvers, you have to succeed on an ability check. The DC for this check is *8 + the target's Proficiency Bonus + the target's Strength* (for Overrun) or *Dexterity* (for Climb Onto/Tumble) *modifier*.

---

**Climb Onto Creature**: You can Climb onto a different Creature if it's at least one size larger than you are, if it has an appropriate anatomy that can be climbed, and if you have at least one hand free. You make either a *Str/Athletics* or *Dex/Acrobatics* check. On a success, you climb and move around on the creature, but this counts as *Difficult Terrain*. Attacking the creature while on it gives you *Advantage* on your attack rolls, and depending on their anatomy they might not be able to target you..

The creature can use their Action on their turn to try to shake you off. You can avoid this with a successful *Str/Save* or *Dex/Save* against the same DC.

---

**Overrun/Tumble**: When you Overrun or Tumble, you move through an opponent's space rather than around. You make a *Str/Athletics* check to Overrun, or a *Dex/Acrobatics* check to Tumble. On a success, you can move through the target's space once this turn. You have *Advantage* on your roll if you're larger (Overrun) or smaller (Tumble) than the target, and *Disadvantage* for the reverse.

You still provoke an Opportunity Attack if you move out of the target’s threat range.

### Close Combat Maneuvers
With the *Attack* action, you can make one of these maneuvers against an opponent within your reach. If you can make more than one attack, you can replace one of your attacks with a maneuver. When you make a maneuver against an opponent, they get to make a *Str/Save* or *Dex/Save* to avoid the effect. The Combat Maneuver DC (*CMDC*) for these saves is *8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier*.

---

**Disarm**: When you Disarm someone, you knock an opponent's weapon or other item they're holding out of their hands. On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but the opponent *drops the item you targeted*. The item then drops to the ground, or you can immediately wield it yourself if you have a free hand available. If it drops to the ground, you can use your *Object Interaction* to kick it away up to your Strength score in feet. 

The target has *Advantage* on the saving throw if their size is larger than yours, or if they're holding the item with two (or more) hands. They have *Disadvantage* on the saving throw if their size is smaller than yours.

---

**Grapple**: When you Grapple an opponent, you're wrestling with them to keep them where you want 'em. You can only grapple an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you, and you need to have at least one hand free. On a failed saving throw, the target gains the *Grappled* condition. This means their speed drops to 0; they have Disadvantage on attacks that don’t target you; and while you’re grappling, you can move the target along with you, but you move at half your speed.

They can escape the Grapple on their turn by using their Action to make a *Str/Athletics* or *Dex/Acrobatics* check vs. your CMDC. On a success, they break your grapple. Alternatively they can choose to take *Disadvantage* on their check to instead become the controlling grappler on a success. 

---

**Shove/Shove Aside**: When you Shove an opponent, you either knock them to the ground or 5’ away from you. You can only shove an opponent that's no more than one size larger than you. On a failed saving throw, you don't deal damage but you knock them *Prone* or *5’ straight back* from you, not provoking Opportunity Attacks. You can also choose to move the opponent to any space within your reach instead of straight back, but they get *Advantage* on the saving throw.

---
**Dirty Tricks**: You can also perform other maneuvers that aren’t specified above, and that tend to take a more situational and caddish approach, such as throwing sand in an opponent’s eyes or kneeing them in the ‘nards. If you want to perform such a Dirty Trick, you explain to the DM what you want to do and what your intended effect is. The DM will arbitrate what mechanical effect can be accomplished and which saving throw the opponent gets to make to avoid the effect, before you decide whether you want to go through with it. The DC for the opponent’s saving throw will be based on your most applicable ability score. In general, any effect from a Dirty Trick will at most last until the end of the target’s next turn. 

Examples include: giving an opponent the *Blinded* condition until the end of their next turn, or until they use a *Bonus Action* to clear it; reducing an opponent’s *Movement Speed* by half by kicking them in the back of the knee; reduce their AC by 1d4 until the end of their next turn by sundering their armour; reducing their attack rolls by 1d4 until the end of their next turn by cracking them on the wrist; etc. You can’t use the same Dirty Trick twice on the same opponent.
