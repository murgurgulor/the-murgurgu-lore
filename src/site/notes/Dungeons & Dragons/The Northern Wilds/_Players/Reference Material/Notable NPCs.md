A list of the NPCs you've met so far.

# Currently in play
- **Fillegrin the Bold**: Pompous elven bard in colourful attire, who hopes to realize his dreams of writing an epic ballad in the Hinterlands
- **General Maeve Esw√®in**: Tough human woman, general of the army along the Hinterlands border. Stationed in Dun Ballantein. Has an awkward sense of humour.

# In the past
- **Terrilick Gumsby**: Halfling Merchant and your current patron. He has employed you as guards for the trip down to Caol Arrad. He is a bit weird about his pillows but apparently they're of great quality.
- **Dooghan Maculney**: Nervous and sweaty mayor of Eskel, who has given you the quest of hunting down the remaining Kobolds.
- **Jon Batcock**: Proprietor of a fancy jewelry store in Caol Arrad, on whom you've unloaded your dragon spoils.
- **Lasair Gordan**: Elderly Elven woman and one of Asainn's three councilors, from the province of Cridhen. Very stoic and down-to-business.
- **Maelon Baughn**: Gruff Dwarven man and one of Asainn's three councilors, from the province of Talagar. You haven't heard him speak a word so far.
- **Vello Cadhla**: Young and jovical human man and one of Asainn's three councilors, from the province of Glen Fior. Very warm and welcoming, although he does seem to lavish the luxury lifestyle a bit much.
- **Riqardo**: Laidback half-orc of unknown relevance to the rest of the story.
