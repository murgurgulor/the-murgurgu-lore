### Events
The party interrogates Wishti McNally and the captain. They learn that Sahuagin generally live deep under water and only venture to the surface side for really important matters. They also learn that Monstrous Humanoid (such as goblins, kobolds, orcs, gnoll, bugbears, hobgoblins,...) are known to kidnap one or two random individuals now and then. Nobody really knows why, but maybe this Sahuagin attack was for the same purpose. The captain speculates whether the Monstrous Tribes use their victims for some backwards ritual sacrifice. The party takes offense to this cultural insensitivity. After concluding their talk, they hear the first verse of Fillegrin's *Sonata of the Sneaky Sahuagin*.

>[!tip]+ Song Lyrics: Sonata of the Sneaky Sahuagin
>_"Oh the Sneaky Sahuagin, they raided our ship_  
_turning our voyage in a dangerous trip."_  
_"But lucky for us, there were heroes aboard,_  
_defending our ship sailing through the Baleford."_  
_"They summoned an orca, they fired their bows,_  
_One turned into a lion, how nobody knows."_  
_"The fiercest of all carried a long and dark blade,_  
_With powerful cuts the fishies were slaid."_  
_"So this was the story of how we all lived,_  
_and the Sneaky Sahuagin received death's dark gift._"  
_"Beware my friends, when you sail the deep sea,_  
_For you might not be as lucky as me!_"

The Sandspear passes through the seagate in the Bulwark and docks at Port Hawis. They say their goodbyes, and Fillegrin implores them to visit him in the Hapless Hag sometimes. The party gets their gear and starts making their way through town. The war effort has brought an increase in the population of Port Hawis, as both soldiers on leave as merchants and craftsmen have flocked to the town. In the busy streets, they suddenly hear Fillegrin's voice pipe up in despair. It seems four young soldiers on leave have taken his hat and are throwing it to one another. Betsy recognizes one of these lads, and promptly magically disguises herself as a captain to reprimand the soldiers. The leader of the group splutters a bit about his father being a big deal and that his father will hear about this travesty, but in the end they slink off. Betsy returns to the group with a different colour of hair.

After Rowan buys some ingredients for a Healing Potion, the group finally sets off out of Port Hawis and towards Dun Ballantein. The ancient fortress built of an unknown red stone sits on top of a cliff, providing excellent natural defenses against invaders. Inside they see a plethora of training grounds, barracks, and even a smithy and tannery. It seems the fortress is a little town on its own and could be self-sufficient if needed. They get pointed towards the General's quarters on the top floor and meet General Maeve Eswèin in a war room, hunched over a large stone map of the area. After perusing the party's contracts and cracking a joke about wall duty, she shares with the group that she sees potential in this ragged crew. To prove their mettle, Maeve gives the party their first assignment: a merchant passing through the small village of Stronbeg reported seeing no adults at all in the town. Two scouts dispatched by the army have not returned. The party is to travel to Stronbeg and get to the bottom of this mystery, no ears required. The party stipulates some more boundaries and receives a messenger pigeon. They head to the barracks for a good night's rest and head out on the road the next day, each with a fresh horse of their own. Nun rides a horse named Roach, Rowan rides an all-white horse named Spike, Betsy rides a horse named Harold and Mariun rides a brown horse named Bernard the Second.

The travel through the mountainous Westlands is quiet and calm, though a light rain dampens the spirits. Nun has a dream in which his spider Barry warns him of his Tangsaost prank from earlier: apparently a little birdie told some of the Satyrs and other Goatfolk Fey, and they have taken a grievous offense. Nun should be on the look-out for retribution. On another night, Mariun shares a story about a Sisyphian bedtime story she and her sister liked, after which they compared the efforts of a dung beetle to the emperor of the story. It was a cherished memory and the rest of the party learned that Mariun's sister has unfortunately passed away, but Mariun has taken some form of revenge.

Finally the party arrives at Stronbeg, nestled against the high-reaching Ballachan Mountains that shelter the town from the Hinterlands beyond. They observe children and some elderly folk painstakingly till a farming field. They decide to hide themselves and observe some more, but they quickly get discovered by a young girl named Aoife. They question her about the lack of adults, and she seems confused about the concept. She offers to take the party to her grandparents.

While walking through Stronbeg, the absence of adults is clear. Some houses stand abandoned, others are inhabited by groups of children. They meet Aoife's grandparents and they are equally confused about anyone supposedly missing. The party spots a family portrait on the wall depicting Aoife, her grandparents and two adults. When questioned about the portrait, neither Aoife nor her grandparents seem to see the adults in the picture. The party deduces that a heavy blanket of Enchantment magic has clouded the memories of all the town's inhabitants, but for what purpose?

The party cleverly discerns that animals in town are not affected by this magic, and they quickly start talking to one of the dogs. The dog is extremely distressed because his owners have just left and walked away. All the big people did! And they carried big sticks with pointies on them - which the party deduces must be pickaxes. The party learns about the town's history of mining Cold Iron, though the veins have long since dried up. The party gathers that the adults were probably compelled to head to one of the mines. They enlist the help of the dog - Dreamwulf - to track them, as well as present Mariun as Dreamwulf's new owner!

After a tiring trek through the mountains, the party happens upon a large camp near one of the old mine entrances. They see a few goblins sitting around a campfire, and a large creature near them. The large creature appears to be goblinoid in origin, but heavily disfigured or mutated in some way. The party decides to head in with their signature move: violence.

Rowan summons a small hyena and turns herself into a lion. Mariun that rides the Rowan-lion with Greyscorn's Halberd in her hands. While this unexpected scene draws the attention of the goblins, Betsy and Nun sneak to a higher ledge with their bows. A fight ensues in which the party quickly rends the goblins, with Mariun absolutely devastating the goblin mutant with a well-swung strike. The party keeps the leader of this mob alive for some questioning, learning that there is a larger group of goblins in the mines looking for an ancient library. They learn that the goblin leader is the Mind Goblin, and when their captive makes a crude joke about his nuts they quickly shank him.

Taking stock of the encampment, the party finally follows their nose to a burny smell. Located a bit behind the camp they find a burnt out pyre with a number of ashen human bodies...
