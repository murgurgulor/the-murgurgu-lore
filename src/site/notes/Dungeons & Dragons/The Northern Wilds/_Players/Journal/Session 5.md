### Events
The party inspects the pyre outside the goblin camp. They notice a bunch of adults, but not nearly enough to account for all the people missing in Stronbeg. Most of the people must still be out there somewhere. They also notice two corpses wearing the insignia of Dun Ballantein. They remove the insignias and send their messenger pidgeon back to report on their findings. After taking a short rest, the party continues on into the gaping maw of the mine.

The crew makes their way through the main tunnel, following the tracks of the mine cart that used to run here. After the last glimmer of daylight fades they end up at a crossing, where the rails turn both right and left. Nun and Dreamwulf try to combine their powers to look for tracks, but Nun can't find anything visual and Dreamwulf appears to be allergic to mine dust. Everyone then turns to their senses and discern a gravelly, scraping sounds from the left tunnel and a clicking sound from the right tunnel. They flip a coin and head right.

Nun and Rowan take the lead in the narrow mining tunnels, passing a multitude of side passages where the miners used to dig. At one point they notice signs of a missing side passage, and discern it must have caved in. The clicking sounds have increased in volume and Rowan thinks it's probably a big bug of some sorts. After some discussion the party decides not to want to encounter big bugs and they turn around to take the other main tunnel.

Heading down the other way, the party soon comes into a large, break room-like hub. They notice some clumps of Cold Iron glistening on the walls, something that would be useful should they encounter any Satyrs, as Fey are vulnerable to Cold Iron. At the moment they don't want to make a ruckus by mining, so they make a mental note of it and continue on.

>[!tip]+ Satyrs and Goatfolk
>Satyrs and Goatfolk are types of Fey and Half-Fey. Whereas Satyrs are generally a jolly folk who are deeply into hedonism, parties and substance abuse, the Goatfolk - a species that came into existence after Satyrs reproduced with Orcs - only experience pleasure from simple violence and aggression.
>
>Though they seem merry, the Satyrs are notoriously bad at taking jokes at their own expense. So when a little birdie told the Satyrs about Nun's Tangsaost scheme, they took personal offense to this goat-like effigy. They turned to the Goatfolk who were equally outraged, and together they swore vengeance.

At the end of the cart rails, the party comes in a small chamber with a chasm leading deeper down. A metal ladder has been affixed to the chasm as well as an old pulley system. Below they see a cave, but also a faint glimmer of some form of illumination. Rowan descends down and turns into a spider to scout ahead. She spots three malnourished, pale humans with a vacant look in their eyes standing guard near a different ladder. The humans notice the big spider but apparently don't care about it. Rowan goes back up the other ladder to investigate some more, but only comes across deadly Gas Spore plants. She sees that some goblins have succumbed to the spores recently.

Meanwhile the rest of the crew descends down, leaving Dreamwulf - who can't climb ladders - behind. Nun makes it down alright, but Betsy and Mariun slip on the goopy rungs and crash to the floor. This alerts the human guards, but Betsy quickly illusions herself in the Goblin Overseer she saw outside and pretends that Nun and Mariun are her prisoners. The guards are easily appeased and they return to their station. Rowan rejoins the party. Together they look around the cavern and they manage to scrape together some Cold Iron scraps.

The party heads to a section where obviously a new tunnel has recently been excavated. There they see around 30 humans, in equally poor condition, huddled together staring vacantly ahead. The party moves on past them, as they feel there's nothing they can do for them right now. The tunnel ends in a hole that drops down into a man-made room.

The party drops down and finds themselves in an ancient library. It seems like all the bookcases, texts and scrolls have rotted away and turned to mulch and dust over the years. Fortunately it is easier to find tracks in this area. They walk through the library, coming across many similar rooms, blocked passageways, and a balcony that shows them that the library extends far, far deeper in the ground. Truly this is a massive building. The party notices their footsteps are unnaturally muffled and their talking is always hushed. Through detecting magic they discern that the entire library is covered in a blanket of magic that forces everyone to be quiet. They also find an intact Scroll of Expeditious Retreat.

After a bit more tracking, the party hears goblin voices up ahead. Rowan-Spider scouts ahead and spots 8 goblins hanging out in a library room. She reports back and puts Mariun in a web harness to carry her along. The party assaults the goblins, with Rowan-Spider enwebbing a few while Mariun dangles in the webs like Ethan Hunt. Goblins assault her like a flesh piÃ±ata, however, and she quickly cuts herself lose. Meanwhile Nun and Betsy enter with their bows from the other side of the room, shooting arrows and spiders at the goblins. Some of the goblins try to run away, tumbling past Rowan-Spider to a different hallway, but in the end the party kills all but one, whom Mariun wrestles to the ground.

They interrogate this poor goblin - through Mariun, who is the only one who speaks the goblin tongue - and learn that the Mind Goblin is here searching for information on the location of something called the 'Dracharkan'. Betsy discerns it sounds like something from an archaic language but she doesn't know the translation. The goblin also reveals that, besides himself and the ones just killed, there are 8 more regular goblins, 3 weird ones that seem to glow, and the Mind Goblin. The party gathers that the glowing goblins might be augmented with spirit magic somehow. The goblin finally tries to make a deal: he will tell the party where the Mind Goblin is if they promise to let him go. The party makes a poor attempt at lying. The goblin asks to be let go, and Mariun takes this as a cue to stab him to death with her halberd.

Then Rowan notices something strange. As Mariun pulls her halberd back, a strange shimmer dances across the metal of the blade. Rowan detects magic and discerns a vortex of necromantic energy being pulled into the blade. She shares this with the rest. They discuss possibilities and finally conclude that there must have been something about this particular killing that is infusing the blade with something, somehow.

After taking a break, the party continues on. They cleverly create illusions of every door they open to keep them hidden. Finally they come in a room that extends upwards like a tower. Inside they see 4 more goblins playing cards. Through their fake illusion door they snipe them all off, and enter the tower...
