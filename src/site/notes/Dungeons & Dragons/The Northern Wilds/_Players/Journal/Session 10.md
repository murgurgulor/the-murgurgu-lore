The group decides to inspect the Teleportation Pad on this side, and Nun discerns that this one seems to be in better condition than the one they entered from. He also discerns a number of glyphs on the teleporter which probably coincide with other teleportation locations. Betsy attempts to comprehend the language, but finds out that the glyphs are names of locations unknown. One glyph, however, says 'City Center'. Luckily the group recognizes a glyph from the teleporter in the Felwarren - which is named **Meadhiar**. They also note down the name of their current location: **Gairbhauld, or Garvault**. Defying expectations, there is neither Garfield nor a Vault to be found here. They decide to take a Long Rest. Betsy tells a story about her encounter in a haunted mine with a comforting yet strange, chaotic entity that spoke in her mind and never left. Rowan considers the possibility of a brain parasite.

The party decides to finally use the mysterious Sending Stone, and they are astonished to find it's connected to General Maeve. Apparently this one belonged to the deceased scouts, and now the group has a direct yet limited line of communication to her.

The next morning, the party realizes they are actually probably nearby the location shown in a vision by the Librarian, denoting the location of the Dracharkan - the Dragoncaller. Rowan tries imagine the location and activate her Cape of the Mountebank, but it fails to move her - indicating that location is not within 500'.

They teleport back to the Felwarren and find it even more massacred than they left it.  Apparently without proper leadership, the younger Gnolls turned on each other in an attempt to become the alpha. They meet an old, scarred gnoll who asks in gruff Common if they're responsible for all of this. The party graciously admits. The old Gnoll accepts their warrior way and leaves them be. The party leaves the Felwarren and heads into the loving presence of Dreamwulf.

Regaining their bearings, the party follows Dreamwulf's nose to Ayla's location. They travel through the deep, dense woods of the heartlands of the Hinterlands. Betsy - against Nun's wishes - starts gossiping and sharing theories with Maeve through the Sending Stones, failing to fully grasp the implications and restrictions of a daily 25-word-limit. Through repeated efforts, the party does learn when Vello Cadhla is set to arrive, and Maeve is asked to keep him busy for as long as possible before he sets out on his tour. She has also sent Robbis to **Tor Ard**, an outpost in the boonies, much to his dismay. Rowan despairs over the limitations of her Cape.

A couple of days into the trip, Rowan manages to spot a group consisting of Kobolds, Gnolls, and a Hobgoblin making camp, that came from the direction the party is heading in. She eavesdrops as a spider and learns that the Kobolds have been given spirit runes for powers, but they question whether inscribing that many runes into the big dragon skeleton is a good idea. This must be what they will find in the clearing up ahead!

On the fifth day of travel, the group reaches the clearing. They look out over a grove in which nearly all trees have been felled. In the center, a dig site holding gigantic skeleton of a dragon is visible, and kobolds, goblins, gnolls, orcs, and hobgoblins are still milling around digging further. The grove is scattered with several camps of varying quality, with a large and ornate section at the far end. The party takes a their time to soak the sights in, they discern that among the monstrous clans there are also a handful of humanoids among the bones, using little knives to carve into the bones. One of them appears to be Rowan's sister. Rowan immediately turns into a tiny lizard and scuttles into the grove.

Among the bones, Rowan notices that her sister has been extensively tattooed over and is busy carving the giant dragon bones. She also notices Ayla - the young girl - looking scared, confused, and brandishing a fresh scar on her forehead. As Rowan scouts on, she notices an elf woman, intricately tattooed all over, with eyes with a greenish glow and a billowing dark blue cloak. Rowan notices the woman from an earlier dream. She heads to the carvers and seems to be guiding them and giving instructions. Rowan scuttles back to the group while Betsy updates Maeve. Nun also tries to update Maeve but finds the stone missing from his possession. Scrutinous looks and suspicions are cast towards Betsy. 

The party discusses the implications of Rowan's findings and deduces that this elvish woman must be the fabled Witchwoman. They declare a full-out assault to be unwise, but do agree on instigating in-fighting between the different groups of monstrous humanoids gathered there. They also devise a plan to get Ayla out, with Rowan's Cape of the Mountebank finally proving useful. As they're discussing this, they also spot another imposing figure out across the grove: Norgomgr, a gigantic Orc-Giant hybrid carrying a wicked maul. Unafraid, Betsy disguises herself as a Gnoll Slaver for the second time this week and through acting and performance successfully implies that the Kobolds are responsible for the demise of the Felwarren. A revolt is instigated. Meanwhile Rowan scuttles up to Ayla, whispers in her ear to trust her and don't resist the teleportation. Ayla nods, and together they teleport from the skeleton back up to the rest of the group! As the Bone Grove erupts into chaos the party moseys away, successfully avoiding Ogre guard patrols.

The party travels back at a brisk pace to New Eismil to bring Ayla back home, encountering a mentally deficit Ogre along the way that easily trick to head off elsewhere. During the trip, Ayla explains that she was abducted by a group of Orcs who referred to her as 'Chosen by the Spirits'. She was brought to the Witchwoman in the Bone Grove, who explained that Ayla had a special connection to the spirits, and that Ayla would have to help the spirits go home. The Witchwoman branded her, after which she felt a large presence around the dragon skeleton. An angry presence that wanted to be free, and the carving in the bones was to help the spirit leave its cage. The Witchwoman had some other apprentices, most of which were nice enough. Some of them seemed to revere the Witchwoman more than others. Rowan learns that her sister was one of the zealots. After arriving in New Eismil, Ayla's father Sebastian offers his eternal gratitude. 

The party travels on back to Dun Ballantein and reports back to Maeve. The party has their suspicions about Betsy and the Sending Stone confirmed. After an extensive debriefing, Maeve sends out more scouts to the Bone Grove, as well as scholars to the Teleporter and diplomats to the Tower of the Boboldim. They learn that Vello is still in Dun Ballantein - Maeve delayed him by attaching Fillegrin the Bard to his retinue. 

The party takes some well-deserved R&R. Rowan and Mariun perfect their mounted combat, while Nun and Betsy get back in touch with Penny Gobbletooth and start establishing contact with the scholar Dooghan Cairwen to stay in the information loop regarding teleporters.

Then the day arrives where Vello is about to set out to do his tour around the region, and the party is tagging along!

As well as Fillegrin the Bold.
