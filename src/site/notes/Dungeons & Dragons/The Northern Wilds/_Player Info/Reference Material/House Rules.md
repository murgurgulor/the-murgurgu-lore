The following rules are in addition to the Rules As Written (RAW):
- You get an extra Feat at character creation.
- Everyone gets One Free Inspiration at the start of every session. You can use this Inspiration to give yourself Advantage on a roll, or to reroll a roll you failed. This Free Inspiration doesn't stack: use it or lose it.
- If you roll for Hit Points on level-up, you can also use Inspiration to gain Advantage on the HP roll.
- Rest and recovery:
	- A **Short Rest** functions as usual, taking 30-60 minutes of in-game time.
	- A **Long Rest** only happens when you take a full day's rest in a peaceful environment.
	- In between these two, there's a **Medium Rest** which occurs after a night's sleep. After a Medium Rest you get the following:
		- All the benefits from a Short Rest
		- You recover a number of Hit Dice equal to half your level rounded up
		- You roll 1 Hit Die + Con modifier to heal HP for free, and can spend more Hit Dice to heal up more (as in a Short Rest).
- Combat:
	- After Initiative is rolled for combat, you can choose to voluntarily lower your Initiative.
	- **Cinematic Advantage**: If you describe how you're using something in the environment to make a cool move, you can ask for Cinematic Advantage. If you succeed on an appropriate ability check, you'll get to do your action with Advantage. If you fail the ability check, you suffer a negative consequence.
	- **Retreat**: If combat is not going well, every player can discuss a possible Retreat on their turn. On any PC’s turn, any player can propose that all the characters retreat from the fight. If all players agree, they successfully retreat, carrying any fallen party members away with them. This comes at a cost to the story: the bad guys will be able to make a major advancement against yo
	- We will use the **Weapon Mastery** rules as explained here on pages 2-4: https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/ph-playtest5/owThVp1CESZ1c91y/UA-2023-PH-Playtest5.pdf
		- Specifically, the Ranger and Barbarian get to choose 2 Weapon Masteries that they have access to. Whenever you attack with a weapon that has a Mastery you have access to, you get to apply its effect on a hit. You can change your Weapon Mastery choices after every Long Rest.
	- If you want to drink a healing potion, you can choose to use a Bonus Action or an Action to do so. If you use a Bonus Action, you roll for the healing as usual. If you use your Action, you gain the maximum amount of healing.
	- A number of Combat Maneuvers are allowed, but they're made against the target's passive skill instead of being an opposed roll. You can find a summary of the maneuvers below.
	- If you Counterspell a Counterspell, something strange will happen...


### Abstract Distances
In case combat starts in a non-gridded environment, the following Abstract Distances are used to describe locations and relative distances from each other.
Characters with more movement than others might be able to reach areas that others cannot.

- **Engaged** (within 5ft of you)
	- You are standing right next to an enemy, you threaten their area and are threatened by them. 
	- You can only target Engaged enemies with abilities and spells that have a range of at least 5ft.
	- Ranged Attacks are made with Disadvantage
- **Nearby** (10-60ft away from you)
	- You are within one movement's distance from an enemy. If you spend your full movement, you can Engage with them. 
	- You can only target Nearby enemies with abilities and spells that have a range of **at least** 10ft.
- **Far Away** (>60ft away from you)
	- You are two movement distances or more from an enemy. If you spend your full movement you are Nearby them, and if you Dash you can Engage with them. 
	- You can only target Far Away enemies with abilities and spells that have a range of **more than** 60ft.

##### AoE Targets
Use the following guidelines to determine how many targets you can affect with an AoE effect:

| Area                   | Targets (rounded up)                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cone                   | (Size / 10) targets (roughly) in a group |
| Cube/Square            | (Size / 5) targets                       |
| Cylinder/Sphere/Circle | (Radius / 5) targets                     |
| Line                   | (Length / 30) targets in a rough line    |

# Combat Maneuvers

##### Climb Onto Creature
If you're fighting a sufficiently large opponent, you can attempt to climb onto said creature. 
You use your **Action** to make an **Athletics** or **Acrobatics Roll**  vs. the **Passive Acrobatics** of the creature. On a success, you climb on the creature and can move about its body, but this counts as **Difficult Terrain**. 
Attacking the creature while on it gives you **Advantage** on your attack rolls against it. 
The creature can try to shake you off by making an **Athletics Roll** vs. your **Passive Athletics** or **Acrobatics**.
  
---
##### Disarm
As part of the **Attack action**, you can attempt to knock a weapon or other item out of your opponent's hand. 
You make an **Attack Roll** vs. the target's **Passive Athletics** or **Acrobatics**. On a success, you don't deal damage but the opponent drops the item. 
You have **Disadvantage** on the Attack Roll if you're smaller than the opponent or if the opponent is holding the item with two (or more) hands. 
You have **Advantage** on the Attack Roll if you're larger than the opponent.

---
##### Grapple
As part of the **Attack action**, you can try to Grapple your opponent if they're no more than one size larger than you and you have at least one free hand. 
You make an **Athletics** **Roll** vs. the **Passive Athletics** or **Acrobatics** of the target. On a success, the target gains the Grappled condition. 
It can escape the Grapple by using its **Action** to make an **Athletics** or **Acrobatics Roll** vs. your **Passive Athletics**. 
While you’re grappling, you can move the target along with you but you move at half speed.

---
##### Overrun/Tumble
When you try to move past an opponent, you can do so by overrunning them or tumbling past them. 
As an **Action** or **Bonus Action**, make an **Athletics** (Overrun) or **Acrobatics** (Tumble) **Roll** vs. the **same Passive skill** of the opponent. On a success, you can move through the target's space once this turn. 
You have **Advantage** on your roll if you're larger (Overrun) or smaller (Tumble) than the target, and **Disadvantage** for the reverse. 
You still provoke an Opportunity Attack if you move out of the target’s threat range.

---
##### Shove/Shove Aside
As part of the **Attack action** you can attempt to shove your target, either knocking them prone or 5ft away from you, provided they're no more than one size larger than you. 
You make an **Athletics Roll** vs. the **Passive Athletics** or **Acrobatics** of the target. On a success, you either knock the target prone or 5ft away from you. If you take **Disadvantage** on the roll, you can also choose to move the target 5ft to any space within your reach instead.
