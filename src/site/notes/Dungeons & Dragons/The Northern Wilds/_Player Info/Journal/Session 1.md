### Events
The adventurers Betsy, Rowan, Nun and Mariun join Halfling Merchant Terrilick Gumsby on his travels from Skalmyr to the capital city of Asainn: Caol Arrad. During travel through the mountains they share amusing anecdotes about laxatives, scorpion heads, existential dread and kleptomania.

After a few days in the mountains, the caravan arrives in the border town of Eskel at dusk. Terrilick gives his guards leave to peruse the Evening Market while he arranges lodgings at the Burly Bullywug. Mariun helps herself to delicious orange-crusted marlow head, Rowan interrogates a dragonborn, Nun purchases a beautiful name-embroidered quiver and Betsy indulges herself with oxhead, conversations about wooden ropes and Beaver Islands, and casual pickpocketing.

Suddenly there are screams and crashes. The party hurries over and finds a gang of Kobolds ruining the Evening Market vibes. Terrilick screams that his pillows are in grave danger. This is enough for the group to quickly dispatch of the Kobolds. Rowan surprises everyone by turning into a hyena, and Mariun gets sliced up pretty bad. Afterwards Terrilick gathers his remaining pillows while Rowan has a laughing fit.

The mayor of Eskel - Dooghan Maculney - shows up and thanks the party with sweaty hands. He requests their aid to hunt down the remaining Kobolds, as Eskel's guard situation is lacking at the moment. Terrilick agrees to secondment of his guards for a nice reward of gold, healing potions and orange-crusted marlow head. The party drives up the price and then heads to bed. Nun makes a start on scouting ahead and monetizing the poor.

The next day the group sets out and makes good time. Mariun is scouting ahead and finds a nice hill to look out from. The ground collapses underneath her to reveal and old tomb. Investigating the tomb further reveals a shocking trap that hurts Rowan - who turned into a spider for the occassion, much to Nun's delight. Children's books and the power of friendship allow Mariun and Nun to disable the magical ward and a secondary room is revealed. A stone sarcophagus lures the crew in, but opening it causes an insidious shadow to attack! Mariun gets sapped from her strength, but the party manages to vanquish the monster in the end. Heading back to their prize, they find that the occupant of the sarcophagus was probably buried alive. There's also a wicked magical Halberd in there. Mariun takes it as compensation for her hurts.

The party continues their journey and stumbles on some Kobold traps. Nun applies some practical investigation by tossing a branch on them. This sets off a trap as well as alarm bells. The party tries to hide - with varying degrees of success - and confuse the emerging Kobolds with the illusion of a trapped guard. A short fight erupts wherein the party quickly takes care off the Kobolds. They capture the leader who has some interesting gadgets. Interrogation reveals that the band of Kobolds has traveled all the way from the Western Hinterlands in order to find a dragon. The Kobold's leader has magical powers and fake wings on her back. They also learn that their leader was sent on this job by another Kobold named Jacqlin.

The party loots the camp and finds a map that points towards a cave. This is probably where they'll find the remaining Kobolds!
